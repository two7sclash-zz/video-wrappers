  Leah makes an introduction to the vignette.
</p>

<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
  Leah: Hi, I am Leah I'd like you to join Robert, Sidney, and me as we learn about electrostatics.
  If you'd like to try some of the same investigations, you can, but if not, that is perfectly fine.
  We'll be using some simple equipment as we learn about electric charge which will be mostly everyday stuff
  such as magic tape, styrofoam plates, clear plastic, balloons, and scraps of cloth and fur.
  Of all those things the magic tape will be the most important. Ready? Let's go!<br>
</p>

<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
  Leah is shown with her hair stuck up on end.
</p>

<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
  Leah: Okay, Pretty cool. But why was my hair all over the place?
</p>

<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
  It appears that Leah is in the classroom with two other students, Robert and Sydney.
  Leah, Robert and Sydney are student age persons and they are in a classroom.
  In the classroom, there is a round table near the door, a whiteboard on the wall and a setup for
  electrostatic charge generation. The students are around the setup. The setup is looking like a column with
  an iron ball on the top. The ball’s size is similar to a football ball. The height of the column is
  approximately the same as the ball’s diameter. The column’s height is about one and a half meters.
  When setup is on, it produces some not very loud technical noise similar to a fan’s noise.
  First, the setup is on. Leah touches the iron ball and her hair stuck up on end.
</p>

<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
  Robert: Uh, I don't know. How about we all go sit down and try to figure it out.
</p>

<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
  The students turn off the setup and move to discuss this effect at the table. Robert and Sydney have
  rods of some material. The rods size is about forty centimeters in length and about five centimeters
  in diameter. Also, they have some pieces of fur. They start rubbing the rods with the fur.
  When the students are sitting around the table, the professor comes in and sits at the table, too.
</p>

<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
  Professor: Oh, hi guys!<br>
  Robert: Hey Professor, we were just playing with the electrostatics and we're trying to understand it better.<br>
  Professor: What are you thinking?<br>
  Sydney: Well, we know that things need to be rubbed together to get charged, but I'm not exactly sure how that
  happens.<br>
  Robert: Oh, and we know that there's supposed to be two different types of charges, but we haven't been seeing that.
  Like, when we charge up this rod and that one, both of them attract the paper, so does that mean they both have
  the opposite charge of the paper?
</p>

<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
  Robert and Sydney rub the rods with the fur again. In the middle of the table, there are small pieces of paper.
  Students place the rods near the pieces of paper. The pieces of paper are attracted by the rods and hang upon
  them. <br>
  Then, Leah takes a scotch tape. She prepares two pieces of tape, each about ten centimeters in length.
  She sticks the scotch tape pieces to the forefingers of both hands. The top ends of the tape pieces are on
  the fingers. The bottom ends of the tape pieces are free. First, the tape pieces are suspended vertically.
  The distance between them is about forty centimeters. Then Leah carries fingers closer to each other
  and can see that the bottom ends of the tape pieces repel each other. The distance between the top ends of
  the tape pieces finally becomes about one centimeter and the distance between the bottom ends is about
  ten centimeters.
</p>

<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
  Leah: Oh, when I was playing with the tape, see if I take one piece and then I take another piece,
  they repel each other. So does that mean that I'm making force when I do this or do I have the opposite
  charge?<br>
  Sydney: Well, I have an idea. So, it takes energy to rub these things together and it also takes energy to
  pull the tapes apart. So, maybe we're making charge from energy.<br>
  Robert: Oh, and one other thing. Are there two charges or are there actually three? Cause we keep taking
  about positive, negative, and neutral.<br>
  Professor: Wow, you guys do have a lot of ideas. Okay, that's good! Um, let's see if we can sort some of this
  out. Let's start with Leah's tape charging I think. And let's see if we can do a more controlled
  experiment here. Okay, so I've got some tape. I am going to take a strip about so long. You guys can do this too.
  Join in. And I'm going to fold the end of the first piece of tape over like that. So you got a square tab at the end.
  And then I'm going to take a second piece, same length. But this one, I'm going to take the corners and fold
  them over to make a pointy tab on the end. So that way we can tell the two tapes apart. Then we are going to take
  the sticky side of the pointy tape and we're going to stick it down on the smooth side of the square tape.
  Just as they were on the roll. So, one piece on top of the other. But we don't have the roll anymore. So, this
  is going to be a bit simpler.
  Ah, I got a little difference in the lengths, so I'am just going to tear off some of the end there and get them
  the same.
</p>

  Professor makes two pieces of scotch tape each about ten centimeters in length
  and sticks them to each other along the length.
</p>

<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
  Professor: Okay so now we're ready. And the question is, "When we pull the tapes apart,
  what do you think is going to happen?" Are the tapes going to get charged? And if so, which one would get charged
  which way? And if we then bring the pairs of individual tapes back together, what do you think would happen
  between the different individual tapes?
