  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
  Leah, Robert, Sydney, and the professor are sitting at the table in the classroom.
</p>

<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
  Professor: So, looks like you got a bit of a handle on a tape charging now. So, let’s look at rubbing again more
  carefully. You were rubbing the rods and tubes there and trying them out with paper bit. Let’s try rubbing two things
  against each other and see what happens. Okay. So, Leah, you are in the middle, you can use some pieces of tape to
  test the charge. And, Sydney, that’s a pair of things for you.
</p>

<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
  The professor gives to each student a piece of acrylic glass with dimensions of thirty centimeters by thirty
  centimeters and a foam plate.
</p>

<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
  Professor: This is a foam plate and an acrylic plate and what you want to do is rub them together and we’ll see if
  they get charged and we’ll look for any effects between them. Okay?
</p>

<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
  Robert and Sydney rub the foam plates with the pieces of acrylic glass. Then they hold the pieces of acrylic glass
  horizontally and bring the plastic plates to them from below. Sydney’s foam plate is attracted to the acrylic glass
  piece and sticks to it. Robert’s foam plate does not. Leah at the same time is sticking scotch tapes together.
</p>

<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
  Robert: Alright, Mine didn’t stick.<br>
  Sydney: But mine does.<br>
  Leah: Robert, I think you need to rub it harder.<br>
  Professor: Why you think rubbing harder might make a difference?<br>
  Sydney: Well, it might by because you need closer contact. Actually, it’s a lot like the tape case, where basically
  you just need them to be stuck together closely.<br>
  Professor (to Robert): Okay. How did that work for you?
</p>

<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
  Robert rubs his stuff. Finally, the foam plate sticks to the acrylic glass plane.
</p>

<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
  Robert: Oh, It is sticking now.
</p>

<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
  Robert pulls out the foam plate from the glass plane to a distance about three centimeters. Plastic plate comes back
  to the acrylic glass plane.
</p>

<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
  Robert: Oh! And if I pull the plate away the plastic pulls it back up.<br>
  Professor: Okay. So the electrical force seems to be a lot stronger than the gravitational force.<br>
  Leah: And since they are attracted, it means they are oppositely charged. Right?<br>
  Professor: Well, you can check that with the tapes, right. Try it?
</p>

<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
  Leah pulls scotch tapes apart.
</p>

<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
  Leah: Okay, so acrylic...
</p>

<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
  Leah brings one piece of tape close to Sydney’s acrylic glass plane. They repel each other.
</p>

<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
  Leah: Repels pointy.
</p>

<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
  Leah brings another piece of tape close to Sydney’s acrylic glass plane. They attract each other.
</p>

<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
  Leah: And attracts the square. And the foam…
</p>

<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
  Leah brings one piece of tape to Robert’s foam plate. They repel each other.
</p>

<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
  Leah: Repels square.
</p>

<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
  Leah brings another piece of tape to Robert’s foam plate. They attract each other.
</p>

<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
  Leah: And attracts pointy.<br>
  Sydney: So, then likes repels. So then the acrylic must have the same charge as the pointy tape.<br>
  Robert: And then the foam must have the same charge as the square tape.<br>
  Professor: Okay, so, now you know how to test for different kinds of charge and you have lot of different things that
  you have been rubbing. You can try it out and see what kinds of charge they have.
</p>

<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
  Leah sticks the pieces of tape together. Sydney rubs this rod with the fur. Robert does nothing with his rod. Leah
  pulls the pieces of tape apart and brings them close to Robert’s rod. Nothing happens. The pieces neither repel nor
  attract the rod. Then Leah brings the pieces of tape to Sydney’s rod. One piece attracts the rod and another piece
  repels the rod.
