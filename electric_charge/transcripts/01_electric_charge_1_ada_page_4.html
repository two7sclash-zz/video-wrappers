  Leah, Robert and Sydney bring pieces of tape together. The top ends of the tape pieces are in students hands. The
  bottom ends of the tape pieces are free. It is noticeable that the bottom ends in each case of students are attracted
  to each other. The distance between the top ends is about ten centimeters. The distance between the bottom ends of the
  tape pieces becomes about one centimeter or they touch each other.

  about ten centimeters.

  Leah: Yup, looks like we are looking at two different types of charge.<br>
  Robert: And we didn’t have to rub anything to charge them up.
