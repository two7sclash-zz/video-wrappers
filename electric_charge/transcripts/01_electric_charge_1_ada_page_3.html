  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
  Leah, Robert, Sydney and the professor are sitting at the table.

  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
  Robert: Well, earlier when we were rubbing things together, we had to rub two different things to get a charge. But
  with the tapes, they are both tapes, so if we pull them apart, neither of them should get a charge. So then if you
  hold them close together after, they’re not going to do anything.<br>
  Professor: Hemm.<br>
  Leah: Well, all the pieces that I had earlier, they were charged and they repelled each other. So, I think that all of
  our pieces are going to get charged and then they’ll repel each other.<br>
  Sydney: Well, we don’t have the roll this time and we have to apply equal force on both the pieces of a tape. And
  there is only one side with sticky stuff on it. So, maybe they are oppositely charged and some pairs pieces will
  attract and others will repel.<br>
  Robert: But the pointy side is the only one that has its sticky part on something. So, maybe just that one will get
  charged. And, so, then the pointy tapes will repel but the square tapes won’t be charged, so they won’t do anything.
