So, it looks like you got a bit of a handle on the tape charging now. So, let's look at
rubbing again more carefully. 

1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,500
You were rubbing the rods and tubes there and trying them out with the paper bits.

2
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,500
Let's try rubbing two things against each other and see what happens.

3
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:25,500
Okay. So Leah, you're in the middle, you can use some pieces of tape to test the charge.

4
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,000
And Sidney, that's a pair of things for you.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
This is a foam plate and an acrylic plate and what you want to do is rub them together...

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
...and we'll see if they get charged and we'll look for any effects between them, okay?

7
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,000
Robert: I got two plates, okay.

8
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,000
Alright... Mine didn't stick.
Sidney: But mine does

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,500
Leah: Robert I think you need to rub it harder.

10
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,000
Professor: Why do you think rubbing harder might make a difference? 

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Sidney: Well, it be because you need closer contact. Actually it's a lot like the tape 
case where basically you just need them to be stuck together closely.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Professor: Okay. How did that work for you?

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Oh it's sticking now. And if I pull the plate away, the plastic pulls it back up. 

14
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:25,000
Professor: Okay, so electrical force seems to be a lot stronger than the gravitational 
force. 

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And since they're attracted, it means their oppositely charged, right?

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Professor: Well, you can check that with the tapes. Try it.

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Okay, so acrylic repels pointy and attracts the square

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,500
And the foam repels square and attracts pointy. 

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Okay, so then likes repel. So, then the acrylic must have the same charge as the pointy
tape. 

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,500
And then the foam must have the same charge as the square tape.

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,500
Okay. So now you know how to test for different kinds of charge and you've got a lot of
different things you've been rubbing.

22
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:12,000
You can try it out and see what kinds of charge they have!
