Hi, I'm Leah. I'd like you to join Robert , Sidney, and me as we learn 
about electrostatics.

1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
If you'd like to try some of the same investigations, you can, but if not, that is 
perfectly fine.

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We'll be using some simple equipment as we learn about electric charge which will be 
mostly everyday stuff...

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,500
...such as magic tape, styrofoam plates, clear plastic, balloons, and scraps of cloth 
and fur.

4
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:38,000
Of all those things, the magic tape will be the most important. Ready? Let's go!

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Okay. Pretty cool. But why was my hair all over the place?

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Uh, I don't know. How about we all go sit down and try to figure it out. 

7
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Professor: Oh, hi guys!

8
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Hey Professor, we were just playing with the electrostatics and we're trying 
to understand it better.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Professor: What are you thinking?

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Well, we know that things need to be rubbed together to get charged, but I'm not
exactly sure how that happens.

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Professor: M-hm
Robert: Oh and we know that there's supposed to be two different types of charges, but we 
haven't been seeing that.

12
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Like when we charge up this rod and that one, both of them attract the paper, so does that
mean they both have the opposite charge of the paper?

13
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Oh, when I was playing with the tape, see if I take one piece and then I take another
piece, ...

14
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:06,000
... they repel each other. So, like-charges repel each other. So does that mean that I'm
making force when I do this or do I have the opposite charge?

15
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Well, I have an idea. So, it takes energy to rub these things together and it also takes
energy to pull the tapes apart.

16
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,500
So, maybe we're making charge from energy.

17
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:27,000
Oh and one other thing. Are there two charges or are there actually three? 

18
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,500
Cause we keep talking about positive, negative, and neutral. 

19
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,000
Professor: Wow, you guys do have a lot of ideas. Okay that's good!

20
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,500
Um, let's see if we can sort some of this out. Let's start with Leah's tape charging
I think. 

21
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:46,000
And let's see if we can do a more controlled experiment there.

22
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,500
Okay, so I've got some tape. I'm going to take a strip about so long. 

23
00:02:52,500 --> 00:03:04,000
You guys can do this too. Join in. And I'm going to fold the end of the first piece of
tape over like that. So you got a square tab at the end. 

24
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And then I'm going to take a second piece, same length. But this one, I'm going to take
the corners and fold them over...

25
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
..to make a pointy tab on the end. So that way we can tell the two tapes apart. 

26
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:29,500
Then we're going to take the sticky side of the pointy tape and we're going to stick it 
down on the smooth side of the square tape. 

27
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:35,000
Just as they were on the roll. So, one piece on top of the other. But we don't have the 
roll anymore. 

28
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
So, this is going to be a bit simpler.

29
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:45,500
Ah! I got a little difference in the lengths, so I'm just going to tear off some of the 
end there and get them the same. 

30
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Okay. So now we're ready. 

31
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And the question is, "When we pull the tapes apart, what do you think is going to 
happen?"

32 
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,500
Are the tapes going to get charged? And if so, which one would get charged which way? 

33
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:13,000
And if we then bring the pairs of individual tapes back together, what do you think would
happen between the different individual tapes?
