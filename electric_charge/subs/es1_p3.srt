Okay. Well, let's pull the tapes apart and see what happens. 

1
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,000
Professor: Now bring the smooth sides together...

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
...and watch what happens. 

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Looks like mine attracted. 

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,500
Ooo, let's bring my pointy tape up to your pointy tape

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,000
Woo, they repel! 

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,500
So then they both got charged. But wait, do they square tapes repel?

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Yup, looks like we're looking at two different types of charge. 

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And we didn't have to rub anything to charge them up.
