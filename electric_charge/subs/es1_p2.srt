Well, earlier when we were rubbing things together, we had to rub 
two different things to get a charge.

1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
But with the tapes, they're both tapes so if we pull them apart, neither of them should get a charge

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So then if hold them close together after, they're not going to do anything.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Well, all the pieces that I had earlier, they were charged and they repelled each other...

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
... So, I think that all of our pieces are going to get charged and then they'll repel
each other.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Well, we don't have the roll this time and we have to apply equal force 
on both the pieces of tape.

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And there's only one side with sticky stuff on it.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So, maybe they're oppositely charged and some pairs will attract and others will repel.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
But the pointy side is the only one that has its sticky part on something.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:07,000
So, maybe just that one will get charged and so then the pointy tapes will repel but the
square tapes won't be charged, so they won't do anything.
