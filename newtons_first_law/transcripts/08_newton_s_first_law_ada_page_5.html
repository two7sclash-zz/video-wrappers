Notice that the speed decreases to zero in a steady straight line manner. 
We call this a linear relationship. The amount of time it takes the block to come to the rest depends on the 
slope of this line. A steep slope represents a large frictional force where the object comes to rest very quickly. 
A shallower slope represents a smaller frictional force where the block travels farther before coming to rest. 
A horizontal line represents an object that doesn’t slow down at all.
