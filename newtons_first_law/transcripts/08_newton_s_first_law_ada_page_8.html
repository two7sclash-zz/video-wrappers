  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The girl shoves the dry ice puck back to Professor David. It slides freely along the corridor. 
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Professor David: You can see, it really doesn't slow down at all.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
Professor David catches the puck. Then camera shows him speaking with the same two boys.

Professor David: Let's do a little wrap up. So, we were able to effectively reduce friction to essentially zero.  
Do you think we could run this experiment in a way that it would really go forever?<br>
Boy 1: I guess if you reduced friction all the way to zero.<br>
Professor David: It's really difficult to perform the ideal experiment and that's one of the things that makes 
motion a little difficult to understand. 
This is an example of what is called Newton's First Law of Motion. 
He said, back in 1687, that if an object is moving, 
if it's in motion, it will continue to move in a straight line with a constant speed forever, 
unless acted upon by another force. In principle, that is true. 
Scientists believe it is true. In practice you can never actually do that experiment. 
You can only think of the idealization of that experiment.

Camera shows a text written by Gothic type on an old paper texture background. 
The text is signed by Isaac Newton. It says: Law 1. Every body preserves in its state of rest or of uniform 
motion in a right line, unless it compelled to change that by force impressed thereon.
