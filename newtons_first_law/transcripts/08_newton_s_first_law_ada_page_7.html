Wow! That dry ice puck went about 100 feet and it didn't look like it would stop anytime soon. 
But maybe it was slowing down and we just couldn't tell. 
Let's do a video analysis to see if we can tell if it's slowing down or not. 
As before, click on the center of the puck in each frame of the movie. 
And remember, a horizontal line represents an object that's not slowing down at all.
