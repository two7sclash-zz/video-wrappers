  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
Professor David is speaking with the same two boys.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Professor David: What do you think would happen if we can reduce friction even more?<br>
Boy 2: It would go even farther?<br>
Professor David: It would go even farther! I like that answer! 
Sound very logical! If we push that to its logical conclusion, let’s say we reduce friction even more after that, 
what happens?<br>
Boy 2: I guess if you could eventually get friction to zero the object would never stop.<br>
Professor David: Believe it or not, we can actually do that experiment. Almost! We can make friction go to almost zero.
</p>

  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
Professor David takes a dry ice puck.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
I have some dry ice. The beauty of dry ice, which is solid carbon dioxide, 
is that where regular ice melts into a liquid, dry ice turns directly into a gas. 
We call that sublimation. So it doesn’t make anything wet. For our purposes, what’s nice.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
Professor David blows on the piece of dry ice and a little cloud of steam appears. 
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
See that’s the gas. For our purposes when I put it on a smooth surface and rub it around to make the bottom flat.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
Professor David squats down and starts to rub around the dry ice puck against the floor. 
Then camera shows how the puck slides freely along the floor.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
What’ll happen is that it will float on a little cushion of gas. 
And so it won’t be any rubbing between the dry ice and the floor. We are effectively removing friction. 
I’m going to shove this the same way I was shoving the piece of wood. And let’s see how far it goes.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
Professor David shoves the dry ice puck and it slides far away along a very long corridor.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
I mean look at this it’s crucial.  
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
At the very end of the corridor a girl snatches the puck and stops it.
