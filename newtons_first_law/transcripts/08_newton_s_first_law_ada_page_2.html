  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
Interactive Video Vignette logo appears. Then the title appears: Newton’s First Law.<br>
Professor David is speaking with two boys.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Professor David: We are here in the beautiful school of law building to do some physics experiments. 
If I take some object, maybe a chair, and give it a shove, and let it go, what do you think will happen?<br>
Boy 1: It’ll move a few feet and then stop.<br>
Boy 2: Or fall over.<br>
Professor David: We’re going to try that experiment right here. Instead of a chair we’ll use a piece of wood.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
Professor David is squatting down. A long rag and a piece of wood are in front of him on the floor. 
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Professor David: I’m going to give it a pretty good shove.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
Professor David takes the block.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Professor David: 1, 2, 3
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
Professor David pushes the block along the rag. It moves a little and then stops. Then camera shows the two boys again.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Professor David: Ok, come on back and tell me what you saw.<br>
Boy 1: Well, it moved a couple inches and then stopped.<br>
Boy 2: It didn’t move much.<br>
Professor David: Why do you think it didn’t move much?<br>
Boy 1: Friction would be my guess.
