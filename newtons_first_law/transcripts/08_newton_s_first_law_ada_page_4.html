Now that you’ve made a prediction for what the speed versus time graph should look like, 
let’s go ahead and measure the speed of the sliding block as a function of time. 
You do this by performing a video analysis of the sliding block movie. 
The idea is simple. You click on the center of the block in each frame of the movie. 
The computer then calculates the speed by taking the distance travelled by the block between 
each set of frames and dividing by the time. You should see the speed versus time graph 
being constructed as you click on the frames in the movie.
