Professor David: We’ve just seen that when friction is acting the block slows down and comes to rest. 
One useful way of depicting this is to plot the speed of the block as a function of time. 
Here are some sample speed versus time graphs. We’d like you to choose the one that you think best represents 
the motion of the sliding block.
