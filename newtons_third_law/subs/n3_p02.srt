1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,229
Uh, I would think the car

2
00:00:02,229 --> 00:00:05,909
the heavier car moving faster would exert more force.

3
00:00:05,909 --> 00:00:09,415
The sedan obviously is gonna have more force

4
00:00:09,415 --> 00:00:10,538
than the small car

5
00:00:10,538 --> 00:00:14,805
Okay, why do you think so?
Just because there's more weight behind it.

6
00:00:14,805 --> 00:00:17,854
And it would have more

7
00:00:17,854 --> 00:00:22,266
momentum to it would be harder to stop since there's more weight behind it.

8
00:00:22,266 --> 00:00:24,320
Well, obviously the heavier car,

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,639
and you said its going faster than the other one, so obviously it would have a lot more power and force behind it.

10
00:00:28,639 --> 00:00:33,798
I feel like it's the same, but since that car is lighter it's taking more of an impact and going back more.
