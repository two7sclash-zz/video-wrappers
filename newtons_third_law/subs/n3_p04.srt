1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,404
There's not much of a difference. They're practically the same as the first one.

2
00:00:03,404 --> 00:00:05,711
It looks like they're the same.

3
00:00:05,711 --> 00:00:07,711
So it looks like the forces were equal?

4
00:00:07,711 --> 00:00:09,023
Yea the forces were equal, yea.

5
00:00:09,023 --> 00:00:12,000
The curves are identical.
The curves are identical, so what does that tell us about the 

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,567
forces that they exert on each other?

7
00:00:14,567 --> 00:00:16,450
That they exert the same force on each other.

8
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:19,717
So that says that the force of impact is equal on both sides.

9
00:00:19,717 --> 00:00:21,136
no matter what the mass is,

10
00:00:21,136 --> 00:00:24,031
I wouldn't have thought that.
