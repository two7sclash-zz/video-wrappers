Hi my name is Laurie, and I'd like to ask you some questions

2
00:00:09,484 --> 00:00:14,084
about car crashes. We're going to be talking about the forces

3
00:00:14,084 --> 00:00:18,661
that the objects exert on each other when they collide

4
00:00:18,661 --> 00:00:20,075
and how they compare.

5
00:00:20,075 --> 00:00:23,157
The first scenario we're going to look at

6
00:00:23,157 --> 00:00:26,037
We have two carts. Can you see those?
Yea

7
00:00:26,037 --> 00:00:29,529
And so, they are equal mass and equal speed

8
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:36,541
Alright, so for this situation, how do you think the forces of the

9
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:39,860
the carts on each other compare? Do you think they're the same

10
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,119
or different?
Yea I would think they'd be equal, yea.

11
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:47,002
Okay why?
Well if they're of equal size and they're going the same speed,

12
00:00:47,002 --> 00:00:49,865
I would think that they'd be the same.

13
00:00:49,865 --> 00:00:52,555
I would think if they're moving at the same rate,

14
00:00:52,555 --> 00:00:56,037
they'd have equal force and push each other away with

15
00:00:56,037 --> 00:00:58,657
the same equal force. I would imagine.

16
00:00:58,657 --> 00:01:02,049
I would probably say the same since they both bounced off

17
00:01:02,049 --> 00:01:04,037
the same amount from each other.

18
00:01:04,037 --> 00:01:08,592
Okay, so we're going to measure the forces and look at that. Let me show you

19
00:01:08,592 --> 00:01:12,257
how the measurement works. You can see when they tap the force sensor to the right

20
00:01:12,257 --> 00:01:14,536
we get this upwards bump.

21
00:01:14,536 --> 00:01:19,517
And when he taps the force sensor to the left we get a downwards bump.

22
00:01:19,517 --> 00:01:22,966
So we're going to let them collide and we're going to measure the forces during the crash.

23
00:01:22,966 --> 00:01:27,294
So now we're going back to the same two carts but now with the measuring on.

24
00:01:27,294 --> 00:01:30,280
So what do you notice?

25
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,970
Well, it's about the same amount except one's up and one's down.

26
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:36,509
Right, so those forces are equal?

27
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:38,622
Yes

28
00:01:38,622 --> 00:01:40,639
Well they seem to be the same.

29
00:01:40,639 --> 00:01:43,438
It looks like the same curve above and below.

30
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:45,193
They're identical.

31
00:01:45,193 --> 00:01:50,978
This time we're going to look at a video of two cars, and we're going to have a heavy car

32
00:01:50,978 --> 00:01:54,470
which is going to crash into a lighter car that is moving slower.

33
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:55,727
Okay.

34
00:01:55,727 --> 00:01:57,907
This is two cars, you see the sedan coming in from the left.

35
00:01:57,907 --> 00:01:59,651
And it hits the little car.

36
00:01:59,651 --> 00:02:04,385
So, we'll go back to the same idea about the forces, that

37
00:02:04,385 --> 00:02:06,985
the two cars exert on each other during the crash.

38
00:02:06,985 --> 00:02:08,488
How do you think they'll be related?
