3
00:00:08,577 --> 00:00:12,504
So which driver fared better in the crash?

4
00:00:12,504 --> 00:00:13,925
Uh, definitely the bigger car.

5
00:00:13,925 --> 00:00:17,736
No, uh, the one in the lighter car seem like he got hurt.

00:00:17,736 --> 00:00:21,594
Yea the dude on the right, that's like face planted on the front of it.

00:00:21,594 --> 00:00:23,185
I would say, yea.

8
00:00:23,185 --> 00:00:26,552
So which driver do you think fared worse in the collision?
