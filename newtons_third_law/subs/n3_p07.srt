1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,180
So what we're seeing here is, that,

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:07,333
when objects collide, even if they have different masses and velocities,

3
00:00:07,333 --> 00:00:11,940
The forces that they exert on each other during the collision are the same.

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,532
Mmkay.
And that's Newton's Third Law

5
00:00:14,532 --> 00:00:17,556
I guess the force is equal but the resultant reaction is

6
00:00:17,556 --> 00:00:19,951
greater from the lighter car.

7
00:00:19,951 --> 00:00:24,517
Exactly, Newton's 3rd law says that the forces are equal and opposite.

8
00:00:24,517 --> 00:00:28,677
So the force on the first car is the same size as the force on the second car.

9
00:00:28,677 --> 00:00:36,338
But think about Newton's Second Law. It says the net force on a car is
the mass of the car times the acceleration of the car.

10
00:00:36,338 --> 00:00:41,386
Putting the two laws together, means that the mass times acceleration of the first car

11
00:00:41,386 --> 00:00:45,130
is just as large as the mass times acceleration of the second car.

12
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:51,547
If both masses are the same, the accelerations are the same, and both drivers feel the same thing.

13
00:00:51,547 --> 00:00:55,592
But if car number 2 has a smaller mass,

14
00:00:55,592 --> 00:00:59,169
then the acceleration must be bigger to keep the equation balanced.

15
00:00:59,169 --> 00:01:03,944
That's why, the driver of the smaller car is affected more by the collision.

16
00:01:03,944 --> 00:01:09,200
Even though the forces on the cars are the same, his motion changes more.

17
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,593
Take a look at the video of the cars with drivers.

18
00:01:12,593 --> 00:01:17,687
The forces on each car are the same but the lighter car's motion changes more

19
00:01:17,687 --> 00:01:19,463
and the driver lands on his face.

20
00:01:19,463 --> 00:01:23,309
Now newer cars have lots of safety features

21
00:01:23,309 --> 00:01:25,771
So the heaviest car may not be the safest.

22
00:01:25,771 --> 00:01:29,661
But doe's it make sense that the same force can cause different changes in motion?

23
00:01:29,661 --> 00:01:30,853
Yea that makes sense

24
00:01:30,853 --> 00:01:32,036
Yea it does.

25
00:01:32,036 --> 00:01:36,558
It makes total sense. I'm surprised, but it makes total sense.
