1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,648
Well since the one's heavier than the other it would probably have more

2
00:00:03,648 --> 00:00:06,720
force behind it as it was going into the smaller car

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,494
So, I would think the heavier object would have more force

4
00:00:10,494 --> 00:00:14,509
and, I think the smaller car would probably be in a worse position.

5
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:17,331
for in a car accident.
So you'd rather be in the bigger car.

6
00:00:17,331 --> 00:00:19,383
I'd rather be in the bigger car [laughter].
Me too.

7
00:00:19,383 --> 00:00:21,583
Okay, so lets look at this now.

8
00:00:21,583 --> 00:00:24,766
Now, we couldn't put force probes on these two cars,

9
00:00:24,766 --> 00:00:28,423
so what we did is we took our carts and we made one heavy and one light

10
00:00:28,423 --> 00:00:31,152
and we're gonna measure the forces too.

11
00:00:31,152 --> 00:00:34,748
So, here we have the carts now.

12
00:00:34,748 --> 00:00:39,779
So you can see this one has like twice as high of the black bar, so this one's the heavy one.

13
00:00:39,779 --> 00:00:42,387
This one's the light one, and they're gonna hit

14
00:00:42,387 --> 00:00:47,086
Oh wow.
So what did you notice?

15
00:00:47,086 --> 00:00:50,378
It's the same as it is

16
00:00:50,378 --> 00:00:53,503
when they both were the same mass.
