<h1>Newton's Third Law, Page 8</h1>

  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
There is a video player at the center of the page, showing the interviewer with the tablet in her hands and a man.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
So, what we're seeing here is that when objects collide, even if they have different masses and velocities, the forces that they exert on each other during the collision are the same. <br>And that's the Newton's Third Law.
</p>
<p>

The video switches to another interviewed woman.

I guess the force is equal but the resultant reaction is greater from the lighter car. 
</p>

The tablet is shown in close-up. There is a picture on the tablet showing the two carts next to each other. The bold left arrow is placed above the left cart, and the bold right arrow is placed above the right one. The two big letters F are written on top of these arrows, with the indexes 1 and 2 respectively. The force F sub 2 has a negative sign next to it, and the equal sign is placed between these two forces, giving us the equation F sub 1 equals negative F sub 2.<br>
The title, Newton's Third Law, is placed at the top of the picture in the tablet, and the speaker says the following.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Exactly. Newton's Third Law says that the forced are equal and opposite. So the force on the first car is the same size as the force on the second car. 
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The title is switched to the Newton's Second Law, and the picture is replaced. The Newton's Second Law is written on the new line, F sub net equals m times A. The picture below shows the bold right arrow pointing at the force sensor on the tip of a single cart. 
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
But think about Newton's Second Law. It says the net force on a car is the mass of the car times the acceleration of the car. Putting the two laws together, mean that the mass times the acceleration on the first car is just as large as the mass times the acceleration of the second car.
</p>
<p>

The tablet screen is updated again. It shows the two carts at the moment of the collision. The following equation is written above. M sub 1 times A sub 1 equals the negative of the product of M sub 2 and A sub 2. 
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
If both masses are the same, the acceleration is the same, and both drivers feel the same thing. But if car number 2 has a smaller mass, than the acceleration must be bigger to keep the equation balanced.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The tablet screen is updated again. 
Now, the left cart in the picture gets bigger than the right one. The letters M sub 1 and the letter A sub 2 in the left and the right side of the upper equation respectively, they also get larger than the rest of the symbols in the equation. 
It shows the two carts at the moment of the collision. 
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
That's why, the driver of the smaller car is affected more by the collision. Even though the forces on the cars are the same, his motion changes more. 
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The video now continues the picture plot of the social survey about the car crashes and the forced involved. The interviewer shows the short video with the colliding carts with the drivers to different people.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Take a look at the video of the cars with drivers. The forces on each car are the same but the lighter car's motion changes more and the driver lands on his face. Now newer car have lots of safety features so the heaviest car may not be the safest. But does it make sense that the same force can cause different changes in motion?
</p>
<p>

The video shows 3 people answering the said question one by one. They agree on that it makes total sense.
