  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
On this page there are two smaller videos at the top. The first video continues the picture plot of the social survey about the car crashes and the forced involved. The man was shown the animation of the two carts of different size colliding, and then he was asked was did he notice.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
There's not much of a difference, they're practically the same as the first one. 
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The video shows another woman who was shown the animation of the two carts of different size colliding, and then he was asked was did he notice.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
It looks like they are the same.<br>
So, it looks like the forces were equal?<br>
Yeah, the forces were equal, yeah.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The picture switches to another man, who's been shown the same video with the car crash and asked the same question.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
The curves are identical.<br>
The curves are identical, so what does it tell us about the forces that they exert on each other?<br>
That they exert the same force on each other.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The picture switches to an older man, looking at the animation on the tablet and giving his opinion.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
So that says that the force of impact is equal on both sides, no matter what the mass is. I wouldn't have thought that.
