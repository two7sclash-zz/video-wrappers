  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
On this page there are two smaller videos at the top. The first video continues the picture plot of the social survey. The interviewer suggests another experiment.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Let's put some drivers on these cars and let's see what happens to the drivers.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The tablet is shown in close-up. There is a video on the tablet showing the two carts moving towards each other. The left cart is almost twice the size of the right cart, and it's going faster. A toy is put in the tiny chair on the top of each cart represending the driver. When the carts collide in the center of the screen, the lighter cart moves backwards really quickly right after the collision, and the heavier cart continues its way forward for a while, but with the smaller speed.<br> As for the drivers, the one in the bigger cart stays still. The one in the smaller cart falls out of his seat.<br>
The interviewer then asks several people the same question.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
So, which driver fared better in the crash?  
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The answers are as follows.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Uh, definetely the bigger car.<br>
No, uh, the one in the lighter car seems like he got hurt.<br>
Yeah the dude on the right, that's like face planted on the front of it, I would say, yeah. 
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The video shows the last questioned man talking to the interviewer.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
So, which driver do you think fared worse in the collision?<br>
Oh, the guy in the small car is screwed, definitely.
</p>
