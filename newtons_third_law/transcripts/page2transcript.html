  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
There is a video player at the center of the page. First, the Interactive Video Vignette logo appears together with the short musical intro. Then the lesson title appears in bold, Newton's Third Law.<br>
In the next moment, the video shows the journalist lady interviewing a man in the city street. 
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Hi, my name is Lori, and I'd like to ask you some questions about car crashes. We are going to be talking about the forces that the object exert on each other when they collide and how they compare.<br>
The first scenario we're gonna look at, we have two carts. Can you see those?
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The journalist is holding a tablet with an animated model showed on the screen. She is turning the tablet so that the man could see what is happening on the screen. The man confirms he can see the carts she's talking about.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
And so, they are equal mass and equal speed.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The tablet is shown in close-up, so we can observe the model of the two carts moving. There is a video on the tablet showing the two carts of equal size moving towards each other with equal speed. They collide in the center of the screen and then start moving to the opposite directions with the same speed as before. 
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Alright. So, for this situation, how do you think the forces of the carts on each other compare? Do you think they are all the same or different?
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The man replies, yeah I would think they'd be equal. The interviewer asks another question.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Okay, why?
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The man says, well, if they're of equal size and they're going the same speed, I would think that they'd be the same.<br>
The video then shows another girl who's been asked the same questions by the interviewer. 
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
I would think if they're moving at the same rate, they'd have equal forces and push each other away with the same equal force, I would imagine.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
Again, the video switches to another girl who's been asked the same questions by the interviewer.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
I would probably say the same since they both bounced off the same amount from each other. 
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The camera shows the interviewer together with the third girl, they both are looking at the tablet the journalist is holding.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Okay, we're going to measure the forces and look at that. Let me show you how the measurement works. You can see when they tap the force sensor to the right we get this upwards bump.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The video fragment is shown in close-up in tablet screen. The single cart is shown moving from right to left and back. The force sensor is placed on the head side of the cart. When the cart reaches the center, the hand appears on the screen, slightly pushing the cart in the opposite direction. So, the cart starts moving backwards, to the right side of the screen.<br>
There is a computer screen with a graph shown in the background of the video in the tablet. The graph shows the straight solid line lying over the x axis. At the moment the cart has been tapped, the graph results in an upwards bump, and then goes back to the initial state.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
And when he taps the force sensor to the left we get a downwards bump.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
Similarly, the single cart is shown moving from left to right and back. The force sensor is placed on the head side of the cart. When the cart reaches the center, the hand appears on the screen, pushing the cart in the opposite direction. So, the cart starts moving backwards, to the left side of the screen, and the graph for this sensor results in a downwards bump.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
So we're going to get them collide and we're going to measure the forces during the crash.<br>
So now we're going to the same two carts but now with the measuring on.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The video shows the two equal carts moving towards each other. The computer screen with the graph plane is placed behind them. At first, the graph shows the both forces as the lines Y equals zero, laying on top of the X axis.<br>
When the carts collide, the two bumps appear on the graph, the upwards one and the downwards one. These bumps are absolutely symmetric about the X axis.<br>
After that, the interviewer asks the girl about what does she notice. The girl replies with the following.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Well, I mean, it's about the same amount except one's up and one's down. <br>
Right, so those forces are equal?<br>
Yes!
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The video shows man the journalist was talking to at the beginning of the lesson. He has been shown the same video with the measuring on and asked the same question.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Well, they seem to be the same. 
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The video shows two other girls who have been shown the same video with the measuring on and asked the same question.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
It looks like the same curve above and below.<br>
They're identical. 
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The interviewer is shown again, talking to another person and explaining to him the next experiment.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
This time we're going to look at a video of two cars, and we're going to have a heavy car that's going to crash into a lighter car that's moving slower.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The video on the tablet is in close-up again. It shows the frontal collision of the two real cars in the street. 
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
This is is two cars, you see the sedan coming in from the left, and it hits the little car.<br>
Okay, so, we'll go back to the same idea about the forces, that the two cars exert on each other during the crash. How do you think they'll be related?
</p>
