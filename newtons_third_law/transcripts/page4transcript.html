  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
There is a video player at the center of the page, showing the interviewer with the tablet in her hands and a girl giving her opinion on the car crash video.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Well, since the one's heavier that the other it would probably have more force behind it as it was going into the smaller car. So, I would think the heavier object would have more force. I think the smaller car would probably be in a worse position for in a car accident.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
Then both women agree on that they'd rather be in a bigger car and laugh. The interviewer then suggests the new experiment.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Okay, so let's look at this now. we couldn't put the force probes on these two cars, so what we did is we took our carts and we made one heavy and one right and we're gonna measure the forces too.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The tablet is shown in close-up. There is a video on the tablet showing the two carts moving towards each other. The left cart is almost twice the size of the right cart, and it's going faster.
When the carts collide in the center of the screen, the interviewer pauses the video. First she points onto the left cart.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
So you can see this one has like twice as high of the black bar, so this one's the heavy one. 
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The interviewer now point onto the right cart shown in the model.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
This one's the light one, and they're gonna hit.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The interviewer resumes the video playback on her tablet. At this time, the lighter cart moves backwards really quickly after the collision, and the heavier cart continues its way forward, but with the smaller speed.<br>
The graph in the background shows the two equals bumps again, the upwards one and the downwards one.<br>
The interviewer then asks the new question, and the girl replies.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
So what sis you notice?<br>
It's the same as if they were of the same mass.
