  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
On this page there are two smaller videos at the top. The first video continues the picture plot of the social survey about the car crashes and the forced involved. The man says,
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Uh, I would think the heavier car moving faster would exert more force.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The man doesn't sound too confident, though. Next, the picture switches to another woman who's been shown the same video with the car crash and asked the same question. She gives her opinion, followed by another question from the interviewer.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
The sedan obviously is gonna have more force than the small car. <br>
Okay, why do you think so? <br>
Just because there's more weight behind it. And it would have more momentum, so it would be harder to stop since there's more weight behind it.
</p>

  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The picture switches to another girl, and then to a man who've been shown the same video with the car crash and asked the same question. They give their opinions.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Well, obviously the heavier car, and you said it's going faster than the other one, so obviously it would have a lot more power and force behind it.<br>
I feel like it's the same, but since that car is lighter it's taking more of an impact and going back more.
