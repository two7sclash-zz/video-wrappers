00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,500
So, what I have here was we had a bowling ball that was rolling in a straight line...

1
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:16,000
...and the question I want you to think about is what does Professor Jackson need to do
with a baton in order to get that bowling ball to move in a circle?

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Okay, so this is our circular path and this is the bowling ball.

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:33,000
In what way do you think Professor Jackson needs to hit that bowling ball in order to
make it follow that circular path?

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Jessica: Hm, maybe hit it on its side?
Professor: Okay, can you come up and show me what you mean by that?
Jessica: Yeah, sure.

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Jessica: So, since its already moving and we want it to keep moving, just maybe hit it in
the direction of motion.

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Professor: So, you mean like this. In that direction.
Jessica: Right.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Professor: Well let's label that "A." Can you think of any other ways that you might
want to hit the ball?

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Jessica: Maybe at an angle since we do want the path to curve.

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Professor: Okay, so sort of in this direction. Like that?
Jessica: Mhm

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Professor: That's what you mean? Okay, let's call that "B" then. Any other ideas?

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
We could always hit it perpendicular to its direction of motion.
Professor: So radially inward?
Jessica: Right, yeah.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Professor: So, this direction. Like that.
Jessica: Mhm

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Professor: Okay, well let's find out what happens.'
Jessica: Okay.
