00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So Jessica, in these videos, what we saw was when Professor Jackson hit the ball with
the baton...

1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:21,000
...he was able to make the ball move in a circle. Now can you think of any other examples
where there's a force that's being applied to keep something moving in a circle?

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Jessica: What about those amusement park rides where the passengers move in a circle?

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,500
Professor: You know, another really good example is a ball tied to the end of a string
and you whirl it over your head.

4
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,500
Or how about the moon orbiting the Earth?

5
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:41,000
But there's no string. 
Professor: So, what's pulling on the moon?
Jessica: Gravity!

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Or what about the Scottish Hammer Throw?
Professor: Oh, I love that game. 

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Or you know, they have in the Olympics where the person throws the discus.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Jessica: Or what about the "Death Spiral" in skating?

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So in all of these examples, what have you seen?

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,500
It seems that there's always a force pulling towards the center.

11
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:15,500
Exactly. And you know, we call that centripetal force and as soon as that force is no
longer acting on the object, what happens?

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,500
It veers off course. The object veers off.
Professor: So, it goes in a straight line?

13
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:27,000
Jessica: Yeah
Professor: It doesn't follow the circle any more, as if it has no memory.
