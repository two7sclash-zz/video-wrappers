We already have Professor Jackson hitting the ball and having it go in a circle.

1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And the question that we're asking is, "What is going to happen once Professor Jackson
stops hitting the ball?"

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,500
So, Where do you think that ball is going to go once he stops hitting it with the baton?

3
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:29,500
Maybe it continues in its circular path? 
Professor: Its just going to keep following this way?
Jessica: Yeah

4
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:35,000
Professor: Okay so let's draw that in as an option. So that'll be option "A."

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,500
Can you think of any other directions it might take?

6
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:45,500
Maybe it stays curved but deviates from the circle a little bit.

7
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:51,500
Professor: So perhaps it goes sort of like that.
Jessica: Right.
Professor: Okay, I can see that.

8
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,000
Can you think of anything else?

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Maybe it just goes straight and abandons its curved course.
Professor: Okay...

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
...so it'll just continue in a straight line like that.
Jessica: Right.
Professor: Okay

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You know, I could also foresee it maybe going this way instead

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Jessica: Okay, yeah.
Professor: Possibly, let's go find out.
Jessica: Okay
