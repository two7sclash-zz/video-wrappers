Jessica: Hey Professor!
Professor: Hey Jessica. You know, I'm really glad you're here. Professor Jackson and I 
have been working on these videos...

1
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:25,000
...and what we're trying to do is show the class what it takes to make a rolling ball
start moving in a circle...

2
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,500
...and I was wondering if you would have some time to help make comments on this video 
for me.

3
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:35,000
Jessica: Yeah, sure!
Professor: Great, cause I have them right here on my iPad and what I wanted to do was 
first just sort of...

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:45,000
...help you to understand our setup. So, what we have is we have an overhead camera and
we were in the auditorium, so I had Professor Jackson draw a circle on the floor.

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And that way once we hit the ball in a certain way, we could see that is was actually
following a circle.
Jessica: Okay, yeah

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Professor: Great. So, before I show you the videos, what I'd like to do is just ask
you some questions and draw some things on the board. 
Jessica: Okay, Sure.
