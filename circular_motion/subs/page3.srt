So let's see what Professor Jackson actually did in order to get the ball to start
rolling in a circle

1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,500
So, what do you see happeneing here? 

2
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:18,000
Jessica: Looks like he might be hitting the side of the ball towards the center of the 
circle.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Professor: He is. And do you know what he's doing actually is he's imparting a force
using the baton to the ball.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And you'll see from this video that when he does that, the ball, in fact, moves towards
the center.
Jessica: Ohhhh

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Is that what you saw in the other video?

6
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,000
Jessica: Yeah, he is. He's hitting towards the center. 
Professor: Mhm
