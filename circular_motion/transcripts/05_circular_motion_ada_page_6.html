Professor Catrina shows Jessica the next video. On this video, professor Jackson is hitting the ball so that
is goes along the circle. When he stops doing that, the ball starts going along the line.

Jessica: Oh, wow! It looks like it's moving in a straight line.<br>
Professor: And you can really see that from the overhead shot.<br>
Jessica: Yeah, it's moving in a straight line.<br>
Professor: So, it's sort of as if the ball has absolutely no memory of ever being hit.<br>
Jessica: Wow.
