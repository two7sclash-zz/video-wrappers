Professor: So let's see what Professor Jackson actually did in order to get the ball to start
rolling in a circle
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
Professor Catrina turns on the video on her i-Pad. On the video, professor Jackson is hitting the ball on its side with 
the baton. The ball, which was moving along the line, starts moving in a circle. 
</p>
<p>

Professor: So, what do you see happening here? <br>
Jessica: Looks like he might be hitting the side of the ball towards the center of the 
circle.<br>
Professor: He is. And do you know what he's doing actually is he's imparting a force
using the baton to the ball. And you'll see from this video that when he does that, the ball, in fact, 
moves towards the center.<br>
Jessica: Ohhhh
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The professor shows the next video. On this video, the ball is on a circular path, not moving. When professor
Jackson hits it on its side towards the center of the circle, it starts moving towards the center.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Professor: Is that what you saw in the other video?<br>
Jessica: Yeah, he is. He's hitting towards the center.
