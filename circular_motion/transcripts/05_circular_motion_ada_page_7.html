<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
Professor Catrina and Jessica are sitting at the table.
</p>
<p>
<b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Professor: So Jessica, in these videos, what we saw was when Professor Jackson hit the ball with
the baton he was able to make the ball move in a circle. Now can you think of any other examples
where there's a force that's being applied to keep something moving in a circle?<br>
Jessica: What about those amusement park rides where the passengers move in a circle?<br>
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The photo of the amusement park attraction is shown. People are standing along the circular platform.
</p>
<p>
<b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Professor: You know, another really good example is a ball tied to the end of a string
and you whirl it over your head.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The animation of man, holding to one end of a string with a ball tied to the free end of the string is shown. 
He is whirling it over his head.
</p>
<p>
<b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Professor: Or how about the moon orbiting the Earth? <br>
Jessica: But there's no string. <br>
Professor: So, what's pulling on the moon?<br>
Jessica: Gravity! Or what about the Scottish Hammer Throw?
Professor: Oh, I love that game. 
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The picture of a man, holding to a Scottish Hammer is shown.
</p>
<p>
<b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Professor: Or you know, they have in the Olympics where the person throws the discus.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The picture of a man, holding to a disk is shown.
</p>
<p>
<b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Jessica: Or what about the "Death Spiral" in skating?<br>
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The picture shows a figure skating couple performing the Death Spiral.
</p>
<p>
<b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Professor: So in all of these examples, what have you seen?<br>
Jessica: It seems that there's always a force pulling towards the center.<br>
Professor: Exactly. And you know, we call that centripetal force and as soon as that force is no
longer acting on the object, what happens?<br>
Jessica:It veers off course. The object veers off.<br>
Professor: So, it goes in a straight line?<br>
Jessica: Yeah<br>
Professor: It doesn't follow the circle any more, as if it has no memory.
