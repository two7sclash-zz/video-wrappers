<p><i>(Transcript of audio with descriptions. Transcript includes narrator headings and description headings of the visual content)</i></p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Professor: We already have Professor Jackson hitting the ball and having it go in a circle.
And the question that we're asking is, "What is going to happen once Professor Jackson
stops hitting the ball?" So, Where do you think that ball is going to go once he stops hitting it 
with the baton?
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
Professor Catrina removes a linear part of the drawing and the arrows. She draws a full circle
and the ball is in the same place as before.
</p>
<p>
<b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Jessica: Maybe it continues in its circular path? <br>
Professor: Its just going to keep following this way?<br>
Jessica: Yeah<br>
Professor: Okay so let's draw that in as an option. So that'll be option "A."
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The professor draws an arrow from the ball along the same circular path and labels it A.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Professor: Can you think of any other directions it might take?<br>
Jessica: Maybe it stays curved but deviates from the circle a little bit.<br>
Professor: So perhaps it goes sort of like that.<br>
Jessica: Right.<br>
Professor: Okay, I can see that.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The professor draws an arrow from the ball along the a convex curved path which goes slightly below the original 
circular path. She labels it B.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Professor: Can you think of anything else?<br>
Maybe it just goes straight and abandons its curved course.<br>
Professor: Okay, so it'll just continue in a straight line like that.<br>
Jessica: Right.<br>
Professor: Okay.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The professor draws a right arrow away from the ball and labels it C.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Professor: You know, I could also foresee it maybe going this way instead
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The professor draws an arrow away from the ball which goes along a concave curve and labels it D.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Jessica: Okay, yeah.<br>
Professor: Possibly, let's go find out.<br>
Jessica: Okay.
