Professor: Professor Jackson and I have been working on these videos and what we're trying to do is show 
the class what it takes to make a rolling ball start moving in a circle and I was wondering if you would 
have some time to help make comments on this video for me.<br>
Jessica: Yeah, sure! <br>
Professor: Great, cause I have them right here on my i-Pad and what I wanted to do was 
first just sort of help you to understand our setup. So, what we have is we have an overhead camera and
we were in the auditorium, so I had Professor Jackson draw a circle on the floor.
</p>
<p>

The professor turns on the video on her i-Pad. The video shows the setup and then professor Jackson
drawing a circle on the floor in the auditorium. The radius of the circle is about 1 meter.

Professor: And that way once we hit the ball in a certain way, we could see that it was actually
following a circle.<br>
Jessica: Okay, yeah.<br>
Professor: Great. So, before I show you the videos, what I'd like to do is just ask
you some questions and draw some things on the board. <br>
Jessica: Okay, Sure. 
</p>
