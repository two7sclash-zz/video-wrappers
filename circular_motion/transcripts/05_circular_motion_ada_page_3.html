<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
Professor Catrina starts drawing a dashed horizontal line on the board.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Professor: So, what I have here was we had a bowling ball that was rolling in a straight line 
and the question I want you to think about is what does Professor Jackson need to do
with a baton in order to get that bowling ball to move in a circle?
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
Professor Catrina continues drawing the same line and makes a circular path, drawing it counterclockwise.
</p>
<p>
<b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Professor: Okay, so this is our circular path and this is the bowling ball. 
In what way do you think Professor Jackson needs to hit that bowling ball in order to
make it follow that circular path?
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The professor marks the center of the circular path and draws a ball at a point where the linear path becomes
circular.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Jessica: Hum, maybe hit it on its side?<br>
Professor: Okay, can you come up and show me what you mean by that?<br>
Jessica: Yeah, sure.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
Jessica stands up and comes to the board.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Jessica: So, since its already moving and we want it to keep moving, just maybe hit it in
the direction of motion.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
Jessica makes a horizontal gesture from left to right.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Professor: So, you mean like this. In that direction.<br>
Jessica: Right.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The professor draws a right arrow towards the ball.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Professor: Well let's label that "A." Can you think of any other ways that you might
want to hit the ball?
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The professor puts the label A above the right arrow. 
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Jessica: Maybe at an angle since we do want the path to curve.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
Jessica makes a gesture from lower left to upper right towards the ball.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Professor: Okay, so sort of in this direction. Like that?<br>
Jessica: Yes.<br>
Professor: That's what you mean? Okay, let's call that "B" then. Any other ideas?
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The professor draws an arrow to the ball, which hoes at an angle, from lower left to upper right, and
labels it B.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Jessica: We could always hit it perpendicular to its direction of motion.<br>
Professor: So radially inward?<br>
Jessica: Right, yeah.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
Jessica makes a vertical gesture up to the ball.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Professor: So, this direction. Like that.<br>
Jessica: Yeah.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The professor draws the third arrow, which goes upward to the ball, and labels it C.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Professor: Okay, well let's find out what happens.<br>
Jessica: Okay.
