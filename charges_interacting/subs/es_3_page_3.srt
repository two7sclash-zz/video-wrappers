00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Okay, here we go. I'm going to charge up the balloon. 

1
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:13,500
I'm bringing it near, but not touching. 
Leah: Wow, look at the tinsel go up. 

2
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:19,000
Professor: Okay, now we're going to separate the walls. Robert, pull that one way back.

3
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:28,000
Professor: Okay. And now I'll take the balloon away.
Robert: The tinsel is still up, so I guess it must still be charged.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Leah: Let's test it with the tapes.
Professor: Okay, make sure you test both sides of each piece because...

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
...one of you said that those charges might be different. 

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Sidney: Here is repelling the square tape.
Leah: Yup, you just can't get too close, but I got the same result on the front side.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,500
So, it's definitely negative.

8
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,000
And it looks like the front plate is repelling the postive charge tape on both sides.
Professor: Yup.
