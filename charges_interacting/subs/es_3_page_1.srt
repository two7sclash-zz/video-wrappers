Oh, hi guys. You still working on electrostatics? How's it going?

1
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:18,000
It's going alright. We managed to figure a few things out with the tape experiment 
yesterday. 

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,500
How the two materials in contact is what tranfers charge in between them.
Professor: Mhm

3
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:34,000
Yeah, so the rubbing works not because of the heat, but because of increase in contacts
between the atoms on each surface. 

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So, in that case, you have one surface transferring charge from it to the other surface.

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So, then they would be attracted to each other. 

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And the repulsion happens when you have two surfaces that either have too many or too few
electrons right next to each other. 

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,500
Professor: Mhm
Robert: But they have to be close because when they're further apart, the force is weaker.

8
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,000
Professor: Very good. Good summary. 
Leah: But there is one thing we're not sure about. 

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:15,000
When we were playing around with the tape and the plates, our charged objects were 
attracting uncharged things. 

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So, we don't know what made those things attracted to our objects. 

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Professor: Mhm. Can you give me a good example? 

12
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Sidney: Uh, yeah. When I was a kid, my dad would charge up balloons for birthdays.

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,500
He'd rub them on his sweater and then stick them onto walls and refrigerators. Basically 
anywhere.
Professor: Mhm

14
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:42,000
Sidney: And that was cool, but now that I think about it, the balloons were charged. 

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
But he didn't do anything to the refrigerator or the walls. 

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So I wonder, how, without doing anything to them, were they able to stick?

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
How did he get those things charged? 

18
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Professor: Mhm. Any ideas?

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Robert: Well, maybe the balloon has charge  and then when he puts it to the wall, some
of the charge goes from the balloon to the wall

20
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
And then balloon attracted to that charge? Seems a bit confusing though.

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Leah: But the fridge, it's made out of metal, so it's a conductor, so wouldn't it just 
conduct all the extra charge away? It shouldn't attract anything. 

22
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Professor: Okay, I think we can figure this out. 

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:37,000
We think about a refrigerator, it's basically a conductor, but it's a metal shell around
some thermal insulation. 

24
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And so we can make a model of that and we can use that to do a little exploration. Let
me get some stuff here. 

25
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:52,500
I've got some chunks of foam over here and we've got some aluminum foil.

26
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:03,000
We can wrap the foil around the foam blocks and see if we can use that to make a model 
of the door.

27
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Let's see. If you stick the middle of the foil kind of at the top of the foam and we'll
just fold it over like that. 

28
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And tuck it in like you're wrapping a package or something and wrap it around so the
foil holds on nicely. 

29
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Okay, so this is like a refrigerator case and the door. 

30
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So we got that chunk of stuff there and we need some way to see what's happening in terms 
of charge.

31
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
We can use the tapes, but we got some of this tinsel somewhere around. There we go.

32
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So we're going to put some pieces of tinsel on the top. So the tinsel, while it gets 
charged,... 

33
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:03,000
...this is conductive tinsel, that'll conduct charges to the tinsel and the tinsel will
spread apart and repel itself. 

34
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Kind of like your hair, if you get it all charged up. Doesn't lie down nicely

35
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Okay so we're going to put all this tinsel around here. 

36
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:29,000
So then what I'm going to do is charge up the balloon and I guess we need to know what
the sign of the charge of the balloon is. Would probably be useful to know.

37
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Why don't you all make some pieces of tape, square and pointy tape. And I will charge the 
balloon and we'll see what happens.

38
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Got my balloon charged up. Okay. You got the pointy and square tapes. 

39
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:11,000
Sidney: It seems as if pointy is attracted to the balloon. The square was the negative 
and the pointy was positive. 

40
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,500
Professor: So, what should pointy do? 
Sidney: Pointy should attract and there we go. 

41
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:21,000
Professor: Okay, so what's the sign of the charge of the balloon?
Sidney: The balloon must be negative. 

42
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Professor: Okay. So, now we know what the balloon is and so what we're going to do, here's
what I'll to do. 

43
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,000
To make sure we're not transferring charge, I'm only going to bring the balloon near the 
foil. 

44
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Okay? And then we're going to hold the balloon there and separate the second piece, the
cabinet from the door, so to speak. 

45
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Okay, and then I'll take the balloon away. And so my question to you is, "What effect
will this have on the charges in the two pieces of the door there?"

46
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:01,000
Will they be charged? And if so, what charge will they have?
