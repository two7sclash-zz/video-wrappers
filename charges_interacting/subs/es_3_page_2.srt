Well, like-charges repel, so the balloon has got a negative charge...

1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
...so it'll repel the negative charge in the closer door, making it positive.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
But the closer door is kind of shielding the back door.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And it's further away, so I don't think anything is going to happen to it. 

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Professor: Okay. 

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,500
Leah: Well, the balloon is closer to the front side of both doors, so I think that...

6
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:37,500
...the positive charges in the boards will be attracted to the front of both. 

7
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,500
And then both boards will have a negative back. 
Professor: Mhm

8
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:51,500
Sidney: So I think actually that since the balloon is going to pull the postive charges 
towards it and repel the negative charges,...

9
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:59,000
...that the first board will have postive charge and that the second board will have 
will have a negative charge. 

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,500
Professor: Mhm
Leah: Oh come on! That's a trick question. You never touch the balloon to the door, so 
they stay neutral.
