0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,500
So I guess the balloon didn't lose any charge to the wall after all. 

1
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:13,500
Okay. So then, that must mean that we didn't really transfer any negative charge at all.

2
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:21,000
Yeah, that seems likely. Okay. So now let's see what happens when we put them together. 

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Slide it back in. Watch that tinsel. 

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Well, the tinsel reached across and it's hanging down now, so...

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,500
...I guess that means the charge was lost. 
Sidney: Or...

6
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:45,000
Or that means that the charge just went back to where it was. 
Professor: Okay.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So what would happen if we were to actually let the balloon touch the wall?

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,500
Professor: Okay, well let's find out. We'll do that, but this time with a little twist.

9
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:06,000
We're going to actually split the walls just a little bit apart. So then we can try to 
use the tinsel to see what's going on. 

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Okay. 

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Okay, I'm bringing the balloon in.

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Robert: Oh, the tinsel touching it across the gap. 

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The balloon is stuck to the wall. 
Professor: Okay, separate the wall. 

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Sidney: It seems the tape is telling us again that the back plate is negative.

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Okay, I'm going to take the balloon away. 
Robert: Alright, and it looks like...

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
...like the front plate is still positive. 
Professor: Okay.

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So I guess that since it's positive, the balloon didn't lose any of its charge at all. 

18
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Professor: Very good.
Sidney: The negative charge is pushed back to the back plate leaving positive charge in 
the front plate. 

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Professor: Mhm
Leah: But how do you know that's the charge that moves?

20
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Professor: Good question. It turns out we have to refer to the atomic model here. 

21
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,000
We can tell from our tapes what sign of charge we got, but we can't tell which charge 
moves.

22
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
What do you know about atoms that would tell you about which kinds of charges move in
metals?

23
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Atoms have the electrons on the outside, so the electrons can move around like in wires
and such.

24
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:50,000
That's the key point. We can tell the net charge of things, but we can't tell which way 
they move from our tapes alone. 

25
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Professor: So what must be going on the attract the balloon?

26
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Sidney: Well.
Leah: The balloon is negative, so the positive charges in the front plate would be 
attracting it. 

27
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,500
Aren't the negative charges in the back also going to repel it? 

28
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:17,000
I mean, since the wall was neutral to start with, shouldn't there be the same amount of 
positive charge on one as negative charge on the other?

29
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So won't you have the same amount of attraction as you do repulsion? 

30
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:33,000
What could be different about the positive charge on the front plate and the negative 
charge on the back plate that would make a difference on the effect on the balloon?

31
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Wait, the distance. 
Robert: The distance?

32
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,500
Oh! I get it. Because the negative charges here are further away,...

33
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:47,000
...the repulsive force is less strong than the attractive force. 

34
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,000
Bingo.
