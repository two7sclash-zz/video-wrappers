  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
Interactive Video Vignette logo appears. Then the title appears: Charges Interacting.<br>
Sydney, Leah, and Robert are sitting at a table in the classroom, when the professor comes in and joins them
at the table.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Professor: Oh, hi guys. You still working on electrostatics? How's it going?<br>
Robert: It's going alright. We managed to figure a few things out with the tape experiment 
yesterday. How the two materials in contact is what tranfers charge in between them.<br>
Sydney: Yeah, so the rubbing works not because of the heat, but because of increase in contacts
between the atoms on each surface. So, in that case, you have one surface transferring charge from it to 
the other surface. So, then they would be attracted to each other. <br>
Leah: And the repulsion happens when you have two surfaces that either have too many or too few
electrons right next to each other. <br>
Robert: But they have to be close because when they're further apart, the force is weaker.<br>
Professor: Very good. Good summary. <br>
Leah: But there is one thing we're not sure about. When we were playing around with the tape and the plates, 
our charged objects were attracting uncharged things. So, we don't know what made those things attracted to 
our objects. <br>
Professor: Huh. Can you give me a good example? <br>
Sidney: Uh, yeah. When I was a kid, my dad would charge up balloons for birthdays.
He'd rub them on his sweater and then stick them onto walls and refrigerators. Basically 
anywhere. And that was cool, but now that I think about it, the balloons were charged. 
But he didn't do anything to the refrigerator or the walls. So I wonder, how, without doing anything to them, 
were they able to stick? How did he get those things charged? <br>
Professor: Any ideas?<br>
Robert: Well, maybe the balloon has charge  and then when he puts it to the wall, some
of the charge goes from the balloon to the wall. And then balloon attracted to that charge? 
Seems a bit confusing though.<br>
Leah: But the fridge, it's made out of metal, so it's a conductor, so wouldn't it just 
conduct all the extra charge away? It shouldn't attract anything. <br>
Professor: Okay, I think we can figure this out. We think about a refrigerator, it's basically a conductor, 
but it's a metal shell around some thermal insulation. And so we can make a model of that and we can use 
that to do a little exploration. Let me get some stuff here. 
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The professor stands up to show what things he has and puts them on the table.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Professor: I've got some chunks of foam over here and we've got some aluminum foil.
We can wrap the foil around the foam blocks and see if we can use that to make a model 
of the door.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The professor gives one block to Robert and one aluminum foil piece to Leah. 
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Let's see. If you stick the middle of the foil kind of at the top of the foam and we'll
just fold it over like that. And tuck it in like you're wrapping a package or something and wrap it 
around so the foil holds on nicely. Okay, so this is like a refrigerator case and the door. 
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The professor wraps the aluminum foil around his foam block and Robert and Leah wrap the aluminum foil 
around the other foam block. When they are done, they place the boards vertically and then move them together.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Professor: So we got that chunk of stuff there and we need some way to see what's happening in terms 
of charge. We can use the tapes, but we got some of this tinsel somewhere around. There we go.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
Leah hands the tinsel to the professor. The professor stands up and starts taking out pieces of tinsel and sticking
them to the tops of the blocks they made before.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Professor: So we're going to put some pieces of tinsel on the top. So the tinsel, while it gets 
charged, this is conductive tinsel, that'll conduct charges to the tinsel and the tinsel will
spread apart and repel itself. Kind of like your hair, if you get it all charged up. 
Doesn't lie down nicely. Okay so we're going to put all this tinsel around here. 
So then what I'm going to do is charge up the balloon and I guess we need to know what
the sign of the charge of the balloon is. Would probably be useful to know.
Why don't you all make some pieces of tape, square and pointy tape. And I will charge the 
balloon and we'll see what happens.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
After sticking the tinsel to the tops of their setup, the professor takes the balloon and starts rubbing it on
his vest. Robert and Sydney prepare the tape pieces. 
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Professor: Got my balloon charged up. Okay. You got the pointy and square tapes. 
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The professor hands the balloon to Sydney. Sydney pulls his tape pieces apart and brings them to the ballon. 
The first piece repels the balloon.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Sidney: It seems as if pointy is attracted to the balloon. The square was the negative 
and the pointy was positive. <br>
Professor: So, what should pointy do? <br>
Sidney: Pointy should attract and there we go. 
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
Sydney brings the second piece to the balloon and it attracts it.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Professor: Okay, so what's the sign of the charge of the balloon?<br>
Sidney: The balloon must be negative. <br>
Professor: Okay. So, now we know what the balloon is and so what we're going to do, here's
what I'll to do. To make sure we're not transferring charge, I'm only going to bring the balloon near the 
foil. Okay? And then we're going to hold the balloon there and separate the second piece, the
cabinet from the door, so to speak. 
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The professor points at their setup.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Professor: Okay, and then I'll take the balloon away. And so my question to you is, "What effect
will this have on the charges in the two pieces of the door there?" 
Will they be charged? And if so, what charge will they have?
