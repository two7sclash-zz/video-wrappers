<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
Sydney, Leah, Robert, and the professor are sitting at the same table.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Professor: Okay, here we go. I'm going to charge up the balloon. I'm bringing it near, but not touching.<br>
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The professor rubs the balloon on a piece of fur and then brings it to the setup. 
The tinsel on top of the blocks repels and goes up.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Leah: Wow, look at the tinsel go up. <br>
Professor: Okay, now we're going to separate the walls. Robert, pull that one way back.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
Robert pulls the blocks apart to a distance of about 30 centimeters. The tinsel is still up.
The professor takes the balloon away.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Robert: The tinsel is still up, so I guess it must still be charged.<br>
Leah: Let's test it with the tapes.<br>
Professor: Okay, make sure you test both sides of each piece because one of you said that those charges 
might be different. 
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
Students pull their stuck pieces of tape apart and bring it to the boards.
Robert's tape which he brings to the right board from the inside, repels the board. 
The professor's tape which he brings to the right board from the outside, repels the board. 
Leah's tape which she brings to the left board from the inside, repels the board. 
Sydney's tape which he brings to the left board from the outside, repels the board. 
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Sidney: Here is repelling the square tape.<br>
Leah: Yup, you just can't get too close, but I got the same result on the front side. So, it's definitely 
negative. And it looks like the front plate is repelling the postive charge tape on both sides.<br>
Professor: Yup.
