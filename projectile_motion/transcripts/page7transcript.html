  This time when I clicked on the ball, I saw that the distance between the lines first decreased and then increased.
  This tells me that the ball was actually slowing down on the way up and then speeding up as it came back down.

  This is the end of the first video fragment on this page. The video fragment placed on the right
  remains the same with the previous page. It shows ten frames of the video of David throwing the ball into the basket.
  As before, you can click on the ball to make the short horizontal lines appear in each frame, showing that the
  distance between the lines decreased on the first half of the way and then increased.
