  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
There is a video player at the center of the page. First, the Interactive Video Vignette logo appears together with the short musical intro. Then the lesson title appears in bold, Projectile Motion.<br>
In the next moment, the video shows the man in the red T-shirt staying in the school gym with the tennis ball in his hand.

Hi, we're going to do an activity dealing with the motion of objects. My name is david and I'm going to be your guide. By the motion of objects I mean the motion of any object, like the motion of an object tossed in the air. For example, imagine a person catapulted upward by a giant airbag.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The video shows the group of people jumping from a platform about twenty-five feet high down to a inflatable attraction on the surface of a lake. At the moment they fall down to a platform, they are tossed in the air again. They fly about fifteen feet, and then fall into the water.

Or maybe just this ball. 
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The instructor throws the tennis ball up in the air and then catches it.

Of course even when the ball looks like it's not moving at all the molecules are actually jiggling around with tremendous speed. In fact, the molecules in the air in this room are whizzing around at like 1 thousand miles an hour. That's really amazing if you think about it. <br>
So we're going to start by looking at the motion of something pretty simple, just this tossed ball. Are you ready? Watch.

David turns to the right and trows the ball into the basket fixed at the 4 feet level.
