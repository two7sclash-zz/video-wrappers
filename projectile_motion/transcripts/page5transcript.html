  Now when I tried this, I saw that the distance between the lines was approximately constant. What this tells me is

  This is the end of the first video fragment on this page. The video fragment placed on the right
  remains the same with the previous page. It shows ten frames of the video of David throwing the ball into the basket.
  As before, you can click on the ball to make the solid vertical lines appear in each frame, showing that the distances
  in each time interval are equal.
