Hi. We're going to do an activity dealing with the motion of objects.

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,500
My name is David and I'm going to be your guide.

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,500
By the motion of objects I mean the motion of any object

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,500
like the motion of an object tossed in the air.

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:23,500
For example, imagine a person catapulted upward by a giant airbag.

6
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,500
Or maybe just this ball.

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,000
Of course even when the ball looks like it's not moving at all

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,500
the molecules are actually jiggling around with tremendous speed.

9
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,500
In fact, the molecules in the air in this room are whizzing around at like 1000 miles an hour.

10
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,500
That's really amazing if you think about it.

11
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,500
So we're going to start by looking at the motion of something pretty simple: just this tossed ball.

12
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,500
Are you ready? Watch.

13
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,000
Two points!
