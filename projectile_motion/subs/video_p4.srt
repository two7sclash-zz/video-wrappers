00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Now when I tried this, I saw that the distance between the lines was approximately constant.

1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
What this tells me is that the distance moved by the ball in each time interval was about the same.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
In other words, the ball's horizontal velocity was constant.
