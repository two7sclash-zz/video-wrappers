First, on both videos there is the full view of the experimental setup and Catrina is under the table of the experimental setup and is shooting to the experimental blocks. The video has normal rate and experimental blocks on the both parts rise up and fall down very quickly. Next, the same experiments are shown in black and white in a slow motion. First, both blocks are suspended on their Plexiglas sheets. Then appears a smoke of shot. After that, the blocks start rising up simultaneously. The block on the left video moves straight-up as it was when it was suspended. Oppositely, the block on the right video rises up and rotates around its center of mass in a counterclockwise direction in screen plane. The both blocks move synchronically at the same height. When both blocks reach the top point of their trajectory, a horizontal red line appears on the screen between the blocks, connecting their centers of masses. It shows that both blocks reach the same height. Then blocks slowly fall down."
