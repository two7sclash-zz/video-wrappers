So I think we can definitely conclude the spinning block had more mechanical energy. That's right, it did. 

1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
But how does that make any sense? I mean, total energy should be conserved. It should. 

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So where did that energy come from?

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This is a good question. Or, where did the energy go that meant that this one had less energy?

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Maybe, because we moved the block off to one side from the end of the gun that

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
as the bullet entered the block, it could rotate out of the way.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So maybe the bullet didn't go in quite as far. 

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And if the bullet doesn't go in as far, there's not as much energy deforming the block... That's right...

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
so there'd be energy left to rotate the block.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Um hmm, and that would mean that the total energy is still conserved. 

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Right, it's just a different form of mechanical energy which has been imparted to these two blocks. 

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Cool! Physics works! Physics works!
