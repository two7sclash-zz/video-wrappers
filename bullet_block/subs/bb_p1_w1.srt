00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,500
Today we're going to do a really cool experiment. It involves a block of wood and a rifle.

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,500
Catrina, tell us about this setup.

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,500
Absolutely. So what we have here is a rifle

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:20,500
that is pointed vertically towards the sky. Now this something you should never try at home.

5
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:27,500
I am a certified range officer and I make sure we are actually doing everything safely in this experiment. 

6
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:34,500
So what will happen is the bullet will leave the end of the rifle and go straight into a block of wood. 

7
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:40,500
OK, and we're trying to aim the rifle exactly at the center of mass of the block. 
That's correct.

8
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,500
And so, will the bullet go through the block?

9
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:49,500
It will not go through the block. We actually tried this earlier in a horizontal fashion and we saw that 

10
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,500
it did get lodged in the block of wood. 
OK, so it gets lodged in the block

11
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,500
then I'm guessing the block will fly up into the air.
It will. 

12
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,500
So I'm going to get well back. Are you ready to go? I'm ready to go.
OK, let's do it!

13
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:05,500
OK, range is going hot. 

14
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:13,500
Three! Two! One! [sound of rifle shot]
