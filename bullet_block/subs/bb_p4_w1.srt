That was another great shot. Totally awesome. I was watching it in slow motion when it was spinning

1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and it just looked great. It was so great. And did you see how it went up?

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It went straight up. I know. It was a bit surprising 

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
because you know, you'd think it would go to the left, but I guess the bullet had only upward momentum

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and no side-to-side momentum so it makes sense the block only went up. It had to go straight up. 

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The question I want to know the answer to is, how high did that spinning block go in comparison to the original straight-up block.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
If we're adding rotational energy to the block now, maybe that means we have to take away some of the potential energy

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
or some of the potential energy needs to be converted, you know, so maybe instead it wouldn't go quite as high.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It could be, but, I mean, it was the same bullet fired from the same rifle, so part of me wants to say,

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
it's just going to go the same height as the first one.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
But also there's this other effect where, sort of like a golf ball, 

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
it could obtain some lift, so maybe as it spins it actually goes higher. 

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It could generate  some backspin and push against the air and go up. Yeah. Hmm. 

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I feel like we have to make a prediction before we check it out. I think that's true.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
All right, Why don't you make a prediction.
