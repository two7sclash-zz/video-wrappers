I've gotta say, that was an excellent shot you made. It was totally awesome. When I looked at the video

1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I saw that that block went basically straight up. Did you see anything else?

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
There was a little bit of rotation in it but no too bad so I think we had everything very well aligned.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Yea. How high would you say it went?

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Well, from the video it looked to me about two feet. 

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Two feet straight up. OK. Well, why don't we try something slightly different? Got some ideas?

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Yea, I think one thing we can try to do is actually slide this over so that

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
so instead of going into to the center of mass it's actually going to go to the right-hand side of the center of mass.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
OK, I think we've got it lined up now. This bullet would definitely come straight and clip the right-hand side of that block.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So what is that going to do to the block? 

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I think for sure it's definitely going to impart some rotation. 

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I wonder if it's going to go straight up like the other block did. 

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
That would be one option but it could also veer off to the left. 

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Yea, that makes sense, too, because if you hit something on the right side maybe it goes off to the left. 

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
But on the other hand, maybe if you hit something on the right side maybe it could swing and end up... to the right.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So what do you think? What do you guys think?
