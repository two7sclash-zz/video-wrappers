So how do you like that video footage? 

1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Excellent! Pretty, good, eh? And what did you see with the heights?

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
They went to the same height! I know. The spinning one went to the same height as the one that was not spinning.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
That's not what I expected. At all. I really thought the spinning one wouldn't go as high.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Me, too. But now in hindsight, you know, I think of conservation of momentum, 

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and I think the bullet had the same amount of momentum upward in both cases... That's right.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So the bullet-block combo must have had the same upward momentum, so

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
of course they go to the same height. It's like, it's obvious, but I needed to see the experiment

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
to appreciate it. But you know what's bugging me, is when I saw them go to the same height

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
one block is spinning. So it seems to me the spinning block has more energy. 

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You're right, it does have more energy! But it goes to the same height.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Maybe the bullet has a way of imparting more to one of the blocks. 

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
But how?
