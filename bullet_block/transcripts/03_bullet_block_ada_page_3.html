<h1>Bullet in a block: Page 3</h1>

<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The man and Catrina are standing near the experimental setup.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Man: I've gotta say, that was an excellent shot you made. <br>
Catrina: It was totally awesome.<br>
Man: When I looked at the video, I saw that that block went basically straight up. 
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The close-up of the experimental setup is shown from the left side. First, the experimental block of wood is 
suspended between the two Plexiglas sheets. Then Catrina shots. After the shot, the experimental block of 
wood rises up to the top of the screen.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Man: Did you see anything else?<br>
Catrina: There was a little bit of rotation in it, but not too bad, so I think we had everything very well 
aligned. <br>
Man: Yeah. And how high would you say it went?<br>
Catrina: Well, from the video it looked to me maybe about two feet.<br>
Man: Two feet straight up. Okay. Why don't we try something slightly different? Got some ideas?<br>
Catrina: Yea, I think one thing we can try to do is actually slide this over so that that instead of the 
bullet going into to the center of mass it's actually going to go to the right-hand side of the center 
of mass. <br>
Man: Okay, I think we've got it lined up now. This bullet would definitely come straight up and clip the 
right-hand side of that block.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The man shows with his hand how the bullet will go.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Man: So what is that going to do to the block?<br>
Catrina: I think for sure it's definitely going to impart some rotation.<br>
Man: I wonder if it's going to go straight up like the other block did.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The man shows with his hand how approximately the experimental block will fly.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Catrina: That would be one option but it could also veer off to the left.<br>
Man: Yea, that makes sense, too, because if you hit something on the right side maybe 
it goes off to the left.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The man shows how the experimental block will go to the left. In the left hand, the man holds the 
experimental block. He hits the experimental block with his right hand from below to the right bottom 
corner of the experimental block and then shows with his left hand how the block will move up and off to 
the left.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Man: But on the other hand, maybe if you hit something on the right side maybe it could swing and end up...<br>
Catrina: Going to the right.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The man shows how the experimental block will go to the right. In the left hand, the man holds the 
experimental block. He hits the experimental block with his right hand from below to the right bottom 
corner of the experimental block and then shows with his left hand how the block will move up and to 
the right.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Man: Yea.<br>
Catrina: Yea.<br>
Man: So, what do you think? <br>
Catrina: What do you guys think?
