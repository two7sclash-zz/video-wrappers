  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The man and Catrina are standing near the experimental setup.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Man: So how do you like that video footage?<br>
Catrina: Excellent!<br>
Man: Pretty good, eh? And what did you see with the heights?<br>
Catrina: They went to the same height!<br>
Man: I know.<br>
Catrina: The spinning one went to the same height as the one that was not spinning.
Man: That's not what I expected. <br>
Catrina: At all.
Man: I really thought the spinning one wouldn't go as high.<br>
Catrina: Me too.<br>
Man: But now in hindsight, you know, I think of conservation of momentum. And I think the bullet had the same 
amount of momentum upward in both cases. <br>
Catrina: That's right.<br>
Man: So the bullet-block combo must have had the same upward momentum, so of course they go to the same height.<br>
Catrina: That's right.<br>
Man: It's like, it's obvious, but I needed to see the experiment...<br>
Catrina: Exactly.<br>
Man: ...to really appreciate it.<br>
Catrina: But you know what's bugging me, is when I saw them go to the same height, one block is spinning. 
So it seems to me that the block that spinning has more energy.<br>
Man: You are right. It does have more energy!<br>
Catrina: But it goes to the same height.<br>
Man: Maybe the bullet has a way of imparting more energy to one of the blocks. But how?
