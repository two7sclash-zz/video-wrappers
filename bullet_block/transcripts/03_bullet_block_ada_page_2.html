  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
Logo screen for interactive video vignette appears fist.
The vignette header appears: "Bullet in a block".
A man and a woman are standing near the experimental setup, 
described earlier. The woman holds a microphone. The man holds an experimental block of wood.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Man: Today we are going to do a really cool experiment. It involves a block of wood and a rifle. 
Catrina, can you tell us about this setup.<br>
Catrina: Absolutely. So, what we have here is a rifle that is pointed vertically towards the sky. 
Now this is something you should never try at home. I am a certified range officer and I make sure we are 
actually doing everything safely in this experiment. So what will happen is the bullet will leave the 
end of the rifle and go straight into the block of wood. <br>
Man: Okay, and we are trying to aim the rifle exactly at the center of mass of the block.<br>
Catrina: That is correct.<br>
Man: Okay. And so, will the bullet go through the block?<br>
Catrina: It will not go through the bock. We actually tried this earlier in a horizontal fashion and we saw 
that it did, in fact, get lodged in the block of wood.<br>
Man: Okay, so it gets lodged in the block then I am guessing the block will fly up into the air.
</p>
<p>

The man shows with his hand how the block of wood will fly after a shot at it. 
The height of the fly is about one half meter.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Catrina: It will.<br>
Man: So I am going to get well back. Are you ready to go? <br>
Catrina: I am ready to go.<br>
Man: Okay, let's do it!<br>
Catrina: Okay, let's go.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
Catrina stays near the experimental setup. The block of wood is suspended on the top of the Plexiglas block.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Catrina: Okay, range is going hot.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
Catrina goes under the table of the experimental setup and is going to shot.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Catrina: Three! Two! One!
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
A sound of rifle shot.<br>
The experimental block of wood flies up from the Plexiglas block, rises up about one half meter and 
falls down on the ground.
