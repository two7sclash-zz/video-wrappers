  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The man and Catrina are standing near the experimental setup.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Man: That was another great shot.<br>
Catrina: Totally awesome. <br>
Man: I've loved watching it in slow motion when it was spinning. 
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The close-up view of the experiment is shown in a slow motion. The experimental setup is shown from the left. 
First, the experimental block of wood is suspended between the two Plexiglas sheets. 
Next, a smoke of the shot appears. Next, the experimental block starts to rise vertically slowly 
so it is clear, that the block also rotates around the center of mass in plane, which is orthogonal 
to the screen plane. If one looks to the rotation of the block from the right, the rotation looks 
like a counterclockwise rotation. The experimental block rises up, rotates, comes to the top of the screen, 
and goes away of the view.

Man: And it just looked great.<br>
Catrina: It was so great.<br>
Man: And did you see how it went up?<br>
Catrina: It went straight up.<br>
Man: I know. It was I bit surprising because you know, you'd think it would go to the left, but I guess the 
bullet had only upward momentum and no side-to-side momentum.<br>
Catrina: Okay.<br>
Man: So it makes sense the block only went up. <br>
Catrina: It had to go straight up.<br>
Man: The question I want to know the answer to is, how high did that spinning block go in comparison to the original 
straight-up block?<br>
Catrina: Right. If we're adding rotational energy to the block now, maybe that means we have to take away 
some of the potential energy or some of the potential energy needs to be converted, you know, so maybe 
instead it wouldn't go quite high.<br>
Man: It could be, but, I mean, it was the same bullet fired from the same rifle, so a part of me wants to say:
it's just going to go the same height as the first one.<br>
Catrina: But also there's this other effect where, sort of like a golf ball, it could obtain some lift, 
so maybe as it spins it actually goes higher.<br>
Man: I mean, it could generate some backspin, and push against the air and go up.<br> 
Catrina: Yeah.<br>
Man: Hmm. I feel like we have to make a prediction before we check it out. <br>
Catrina: I think that's true. <br>
Man: All right. Why don't you make a prediction?
