  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
Leah, Robert, Sydney, and the professor are sitting at the table in the classroom.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Professor: It’s a difficult issue. It turns out to understand that, you need to know something about the quantum mechanics of atomic physics. That is beyond what we are going to do this course. But let me just show you an example of that. We’ve got foam plates here and we have been rubbing them with things.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The professor takes the foam plate and a piece of fur. Then he rubs the plate with the piece of fur.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Professor: I rubbed this foam plate with fur. That stick really well.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The professor holds the foam plate vertically and the piece of fur is stuck to the plate. Then the professor takes another foam plate and a paper towel. He rubs the plate with the paper towel.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Professor: Here is another exactly identical foam plate. I rub it with the paper towel. Almost nothing happens between them. So it really depends upon the nature of the pairs of the materials that you are working with. With the tapes we have been working with, when we pull them apart, we break some of the bonds in the sticky stuff that is in between them. And parts of those molecules tend to have an extra electron and parts of them tend to have lost an electron. And so enough of those breaks occur in that way that we get attraction between them. Opposite charges.<br>
Leah: So, if I understand this the right way, it means that the sticky stuff sort of has a chemical reaction with the smooth side of the tape. So then when you pull them apart, the tape that was on top that lost some sticky stuff, it lost some of its charge. And they are oppositely charged now because one tape has more electrons and the other tape lost a few electrons.<br>
Professor: Good summary.
