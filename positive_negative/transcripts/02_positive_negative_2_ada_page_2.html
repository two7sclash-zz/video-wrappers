Logo screen for interactive video vignette appears fist.<br>
Video header appears: Positive and negative charge.<br>
Leah prefaces the vignette.

Leah: In our first investigation, we learned that there are two types of electric charge. For now, we are calling them “pointy charge” and “square charge”. We learned that they really are different since like-charged objects repel each other and unlike-charged objects attract each other. In our next set of investigations, we will explore how things actually become charged and what it means to call a charge either positive or negative.

Leah, Robert, and Sydney are sitting at the table and playing with pieces of scotch tape by bringing them closer to each other or increasing distance between them and looking whether the pieces of tape repel or attract each other. The professor is sitting at the table, too.

Leah: Okay, so now I think I understand what happened with my hair earlier.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The video from previous vignette of Leah’s face with her long hair stuck up on end is briefly shown.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Leah: Just like two tapes, that have the same charge, they all repelled each other.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
Leah, Robert, Sydney, and the professor are again shown sitting at the table.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Leah: But what I do not understand is why when you pull two tapes apart, they become oppositely charged.<br>
Professor: Good question. You actually know a lot about that, but we just have to apply your knowledge. Think about the tapes and the sticky stuff. What are they made of?<br>
Robert: You mean like on a really small scale? Like atoms?<br>
Professor: Yeah, on a small scale.<br>
Sydney: Well, everything’s made of atoms. So, atoms and molecules, I guess.<br>
Professor: Okay. So, where does charge come into this?<br>
Leah: Protons and electrons are in the charged parts of atoms.<br> 
Sydney: And molecules are made from atoms.<br>
Professor: Okay, so now what holds the atoms together in the molecule?<br>
Robert: Chemical bonds.<br>
Sydney: Okay, chemical bonds are when atoms kind of share electrons.<br>
Professor: Okay, can you say more about that?<br>
Sydney: Well, when atoms come together, the electrons from one of the atoms kind of are attracted more to the space in between the two atoms.<br>
Robert: Oh, so then the electrons that are in between the atoms will attract the other part of the atom that is more positive. And so it’ll kind of hold the whole thing together.<br> 
Professor: Very good. So, now what happens when we break the bonds between atoms in the molecule?
