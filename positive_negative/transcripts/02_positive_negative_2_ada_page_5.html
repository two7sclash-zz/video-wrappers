  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
Leah, Robert, Sydney, and the professor are sitting at the table in the classroom.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Sydney: Okay, I think I understand. But another question, “How can we tell which is positive and which is negative?”<br>
Professor: Okay, is there any electrical situation where you can tell what is positive and what is negative?<br>
Robert: A battery. The top thingy, it is positive.<br>
Professor: How do you know?<br>
Leah: It says so right on the battery.<br>
Sydney: But, is that the same type of electricity?<br>
Professor: That is a very good question. Michael Faraday did a little series of investigations to test that very thing almost 200 years ago. Tell you what. We’ll go high tech, we got a charge censor setup over at the next table. Why don’t we go over and see if we can make use of that and find out what is going on.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
Leah, Robert, Sydney, and the professor stand up from the table and walk to another table in the classroom. Then they sit down at another table.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Professor: Ok, guys. This is a charge censor.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The professor takes the small black box with two black wires at the both opposite sides of the box from the table and shows it to Leah, Robert and Sydney.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Professor: It is a sensitive device that allows us to detect electrostatic charge. You can find more about how it works later on. But today we’ll just use it to tell us what is positive and what is negative. Okay, to use this thing, first we have to make sure if we zeroed it. I’ve connected the red lead from it to the ground lead.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The professor shows to Leah, Robert and Sydney a red wire, which is connected to another one of black color.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Professor: And I am now going to push the “zero” button.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The professor pushes the “zero” button on the sensor.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Professor: So now it is going to be zeroed. I have also got a couple batteries over here.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The professor shows two yellow batteries on the table to Leah, Robert and Sydney.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Professor: The two batteries are stuck together. And our ground lead is connected to the junction between them.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The professor touches a black wire connected to the batteries to show to Leah, Robert and Sydney this connection.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Professor: So now what we are going to do is to disconnect the red lead here and we will see if we can use it to determine the sign of the charge.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The professor disconnects the red lead from the ground lead and clicks the PC mouse, which is on the table, too.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Professor: So, we will start with this thing running and… 
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
Now a PC screen is shown. In the PC screen there is a program window in full screen mode. In the screen there is a coordinate net with five horizontal lines and four vertical lines. The lines are evenly distributed in the screen. Also in the screen there is a blue curve, which starts a little below the central horizontal line and goes to it at the left hand side of the screen. The blue curve starts going very slowly from the left side of the coordinate net to the right with passing time very closely to the central horizontal line of the coordinate net.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Professor: … then zero it again. Okay, Robert pick up the red lead and bring it near the positive terminal of that pairs of batteries.<br>
Robert: All right.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
Robert picks up the red lead and brings it near the positive terminal of that pairs of batteries. The blue curve in the PC screen runs to the top of the coordinate net very fast, drawing vertical line to the top of the net.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Robert: And look! It goes positive.<br>
Professor: Okay, very good. Now bring it to the negative terminal. Let me zero it first.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The blue curve on the PC screen goes horizontally at the top of the coordinate grid. Professor pushes the “zero” button on the sensor. The blue curve goes very fast down to the central line of the coordinate net, drawing a vertical line. Robert brings the red lead to the negative terminal of the batteries pair. The blue curve in PC screen goes very fast down to the bottom of the coordinate net, drawing another vertical line.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Robert: Oh! It goes negative.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
Leah, Sydney, the professor, and Robert are shown again sitting at the table in the classroom.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Professor: Okay so now we have got a device that we can use to detect negative and positive charge. So let’s set it up and see if we can figure out what happens with the pointy and square tapes.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
In the middle of the table, there is a small experimental setup. On the table, there is a thirty by thirty centimeters piece of aluminum foil. On the middle of the foil there is a glass support of about ten centimeters in diameter and twenty centimeters in height. On the top of the support, there is a green metallic can with its bottom on the top.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Professor: Okay. I am going to take and connect the red lead to this can here and we will actually stop this graph and start it again here in a second. So now let’s see.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The professor takes the red lead and connects it to the can. Then he pushes the “zero” button on the sensor. 
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Professor (to Robert): You want to clear the data on that, please?
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
Robert presses some keys on PC keyboard. 
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Professor: All right, so we are ready to go. This can is going to act as a sensitive antenna to detect what happens. And we have got the sheet of aluminum foil here that will act like a reference.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The professor touches the aluminum foil sheet on the table to show it to Leah, Robert and Sydney. 
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Professor: Just like the piece of aluminum foil connected in between the two batteries acted as a reference there.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The professor touches the pair of the batteries to show Leah, Robert and Sydney what he is talking about.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Professor: Got some new pointy and square tapes ready to go?
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
Sydney and Robert prepare their stuck tapes.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Professor: Okay, we will start our data.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The professor pushes the “zero” button on the sensor. Robert pulls his stuck tapes apart.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Professor: Zero it again, okay.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
Sydney pulls his stuck tapes apart.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Robert: So, when I bring the pointy tape in…
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
On the PC screen there is an updated graph. There is the same coordinate net. The blue curve starts from the middle left position on the screen, drawing a nearly horizontal line. Robert brings his pointy tape to the can. The blue curve on PC screen goes up to the PC screen, drawing a vertical line.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Leah: It goes positive.<br>
Robert: And when I take it away…
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
Robert takes away his pointy tape from the can. The blue curve on PC screen goes down very fast to the central horizontal line of the coordinate net, drawing a vertical line.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Sydney: It goes down. Bring it in. 
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The blue curve on PC screen goes slowly from the left to the right around the central horizontal line of the coordinate net, drawing a horizontal line. Robert brings his pointy tape to the can again. The blue curve goes up very fast to the top, drawing a vertical line.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Leah: That is pretty cool.<br>
Robert: Yeah, so I guess the pointy tape must be positive.<br>
Sydney: Okay.<br>
Professor: We will zero it again.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The professor pushes the “zero” button on the sensor.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Sydney: All right, well here comes the square tapes.<br>
Leah: That is definitely negative.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
Sydney brings his square tape to the can. The blue curve on the PC screen goes very fast from the middle position near the central horizontal line of the coordinate net down to the bottom, drawing a vertical line. Sydney takes his square tape away. The blue curve on the PC screen goes very fast up from the bottom of the coordinate net to the central horizontal line of the coordinate net.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Robert: Ooo! What happens when I bring them both in?
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
Robert brings his both pointy and square tapes to the can. The blue curve on the PC screen goes around central horizontal line of the coordinate net, drawing a nearly horizontal line. 
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Leah: It goes up to back around zero.<br>
Robert: Huh. Oh, look! If I change the distances, I can make the line go up and down. 
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
Robert plays with the distances between the tapes and the can. The blue curve on the PC screen really goes up and down around the central horizontal line of the coordinate net.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Sydney: Okay, bring the tapes together and then bring them in.<br>
Professor: Okay, hold it. I am going to restart this.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The professor pushes the “zero” button on the sensor.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Professor: And… okay we are ready to go.<br>
Robert: Alright. So if I bring them both together stuck…
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The professor restarts the graph on the PC screen. The blue curve starts from the middle left position of the screen, drawing a nearly horizontal line around the central horizontal line of the coordinate net. Robert brings both his tapes together to the can. The blue curve is still drawing a nearly horizontal line around the central horizontal line of the coordinate net.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Leah: Hmm, it is around zero, but not quite.<br>
Professor: That is right. It turns out that in handling the tapes, you might add a little bit of charge or take a little bit of charge away…
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
Robert takes his tapes away.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Professor: … and you actually have to be careful about whether you are scattering around in your chair or something, you can get charge. In fact, if you watch electronic technicians, they often have a wrist band that is connected to a wire to ground. That is so they do not any stray charge and maybe zap the chip they’re working with. Okay, so now you have something you can find out about charges with.<br>
Robert: Yeah, we can measure the charges of all the stuff we have been using.<br>
Professor: Very good. Well, I have got to go now, so I’ll leave you all and drop back in later and see if you have any questions. Have fun.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The professor stands up and goes away from the table.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Leah: Sydney, how about you clear the data and we can start over.<br>
Sydney: All right, sure.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
Sydney restarts the data. Leah rubs a rod with a piece of red textile. Robert rubs a foam plate with a piece of fur.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Robert (to Sydney): Yeah, push it again.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
Leah finishes rubbing the rod with the piece of textile.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Leah: All right, I am charged.<br>
Robert: All right.<br>
Sydney: All right, let me zero it. Bring it in.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
Sydney pushes the “zero” button on the sensor and restarts the graph on the PC screen. The blue curve on the PC screen again starts from the middle left position of the PC screen, drawing a nearly horizontal line from left to right around the central horizontal line of the coordinate net. Leah brings her rod to the can. The blue line goes down very fast to the bottom of the screen, drawing a vertical line.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Robert: All right, that is negatively charged. How about the foam plate?<br>
Sydney: Let me zero it again. There we go. Looks like…
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
Leah takes away her rod. The blue curve goes up from the bottom of the screen to the middle position near the central horizontal line of the coordinate net, drawing a vertical line. Robert brings his foam plate to the can. The blue curve on the PC screen goes down very fast, drawing a vertical line to the bottom of the coordinate net. Then Robert takes his foam plate away. The blue curve on the PC screen goes up very fast from the bottom of the PC screen to the middle position near the central horizontal line of the coordinate net, drawing another vertical line.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
All: That is really negative.<br>
Sydney: Let me zero it one more time.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
Sydney pushes the “zero” button on the sensor. The blue curve on the PC screen goes around the central horizontal line of the coordinate net, drawing a nearly horizontal line.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Robert: And what about the fur?
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
Robert brings the piece of fur to the can. The blue curve on the PC screen goes a little bit up from the central position drawing a horizontal line a little bit above the central horizontal line of the coordinate net. Robert takes the piece of fur away. The blue curve goes down back to the central position around the central horizontal line of the coordinate net, drawing horizontal a nearly line.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Robert: It is a little positive.
