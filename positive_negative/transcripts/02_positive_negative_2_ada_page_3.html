  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
Leah, Robert, Sydney, and the professor are sitting at the table in the classroom.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Robert: One of the atoms could keep an extra electron and end up negative and the other atom would’ve lost an electron and so it is positive.<br>
Leah: Or the atom that lost the electron could get it back again and then both atoms would be neutral.<br>
Sydney: Or maybe both could happen, depending on the atoms involved. But I am not sure why.
