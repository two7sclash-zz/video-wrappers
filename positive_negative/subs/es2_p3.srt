Its a difficult issue. It turns out to understand that, you need to know something about
the quantum mechanics of atomic physics. 

1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
That's beyond what we'e going to do this course. But let me just show you an example
of that.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We've got foam plates here and we've been rubbing them with things. I rubbed this foam
plate with fur.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:32,500
That stick really well. Here's another exactly identical foam plate. I rub it with the 
paper towel. Almost nothing happens between them.

4
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:38,000
So really depends upon the nature of the pairs of materials that you're working with. 

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:46,000
With the tapes we've been working with, when we pull them apart, we break some of the 
bonds in the sticky stuff that's in between them. 

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And parts of those molecules tend to have an extra electron and parts of them tend to 
have lost an electron.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And so enough of those breaks occur in that way that we get attraction between them.
Opposite charges. 

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So, if I understand this the right way, it means that the sticky stuff sort of has a 
chemical reaction with the smooth side of the tape. 

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So then when you pull them apart, the tape that was on top that lost some sticky stuff,
it lost some of its charge. 

10
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And they're oppositely charged now because one tape has more electrons and the other tape
lost a few electrons. 

11
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Professor: Good summary.
