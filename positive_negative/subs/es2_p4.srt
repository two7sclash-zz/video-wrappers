0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,500
Okay, I think I understand. But another question, "How can wee tell which is postive 
and which is negative?"

1
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:15,000
Professor: Okay, is there any electrical situation where you can tell what's positive and 
what's negative?

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
A battery. The top thingy, it's postive.
Professor: How do you know?

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,500
It says so right on the battery. 

4
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,000
But is that the same type of electricity?
Professor: That's a very good question.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,500
Michael Faraday did a little series of investigations to test that very thing almost 200
years ago. 

6
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:39,500
Tell you what. We'll go high tech, we got a charge sensor set up over at the next table. 

7
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:45,000
Why don't we go and see if we can make use that and find out what's going on. 

8
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:59,500
Okay guys. This is a charge sensor. 

9
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:06,000
It's a sensitive device that allows us to detect electrostatic charge. You can find out 
about how it works later on. 

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,500
But today we'll just use it to tell us what's positive and what's negative. 

11
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:18,500
Okay, to use this thing, first we have to make sure if we zeroed it. I've connected the 
red lead from it to the ground lead. 

12
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:27,500
And I'm now going to press the "zero" button. So now it's going to be zeroed. I've also
got a couple batteries over here. The two batteries are stuck together. 

13
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,000
And our ground lead is connected to the junction between them.

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So now what we're going to do is to disconnect the red lead here and we'll see if we can 
use it to determine the sign of the charge.

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So, we'll start with this thing running and...

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,500
..then zero it agin. Okay, Robert pick up the red lead and bring it near the postive 
terminal of that pair of batteries. 

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,500
Robert: Alright. And look! It goes postive.

18
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:02,500
Professor: Okay, very good. Now bring it to the negatie terminal. Let me zero it first. 
Okay bring it near the negative terminal. 

19
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:06,000
Robert: Oh! It goes negative. 

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,250
Professor: Okay so now we've got a device that we can use to detect negative and positive
charge. 

21
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:19,000
So let's set it up and see if we can figure out what happens with the pointy and square
tapes.

22
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,500
Okay. I'm going to take and connect the red lead to this can here and we'll... 

23
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:33,000
...actually stop this graph and start it again here in a second. So now, let's see. 

24
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You want to clear the data on that, please? 

25
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:43,000
Alright, so we're ready to go. This can is going to act as a sensitive antenna to detect
what happens. 

26
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And we've got the sheet of aluminum foil here that'll act like a reference.

27
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,500
Just like the piece of aluminum foil connected in between the two batteries acted as a 
reference there.

28
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:57,000
Got some new pointy and square tapes ready to go? 

29
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Okay, we'll start our data.

30
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,500
Zero it again, okay. 
Robert: So, when I bring the pointy tape in

31
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:14,000
Leah: It goes positive. 
Robert: And when I take it away. 

32
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Sidney: It goes down. Bring it in. 

33
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:24,500
Leah: That's pretty cool. 
Robert: Yeah, so I guess the pointy tape must be postive.  

34
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,000
Sidney: Okay.
Professor: We'll zero it again 

35
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:32,000
Sidney: Alright, well here comes the square tape. 
Leah: That's definitely negative. 

36
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Robert: Ooo! What happens when I bring them both in? 

37
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Leah: It goes up to back around zero.
Robert: Huh 

38
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,500
Robert: Oh, look! If I change the distances, I can make the line go up and down.  

39
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:56,000
Sidney: Okay, bring the tapes together and then bring them in.
Professor: Okay, hold it. I'm going to restart this. 

40
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,500
Professor: And... okay we're ready to go. 

41
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:06,000
Robert: Alright. So if bring them both together stuck,...

42
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Leah: Hmm, it's around zero, but not quite.
Professor: That's right. It turns out that in handling tapes, you might add a little
bit of charge or take a little bit of charge away...

43
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,500
...and you actually have to be careful about whether you're scuttering around in your 
chair or something, you can get charge.

44
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:29,000
In fact, if you watch electronic technicians, they often have a wrist band that's 
connected to a wire to ground.

45
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
That's so they don't any stray charge and maybe zap the chip. 

46
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,500
Okay, so now you have something you can find out about charges with. 

47
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:42,500
Robert: Yeah, we can measure the charges of all the stuff we've been using. 

48
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:51,000
Professor: Very good. Well, I've got to go now, so I'll leave you all and drop back in 
later and see if you have any questions. Have fun. 

49
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Sidney, how about you clear the data and we can start over. 
Sidney: Alright, sure. 

50
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,500
Robert: Yeah, push it again.

51
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:10,000
Leah: Alright, I'm charged. 
Robert: Alright. 
Sidney: Alright, let me zero it. Bring it in. 

52
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:16,000
Robert: Alright, that's negatively charged. How about the foam plate?
Sidney: Let me zero it again. There we go. Looks like...

53
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
All: That's really negative
Sidney: Let me zero it one more time

54
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Robert: And what about the fur?

55
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It's a little postive.
