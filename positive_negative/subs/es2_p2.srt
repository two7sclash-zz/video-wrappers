One of the atoms could keep an extra electron and end up negative...

1
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:10,500
...and then the other atom would've lost an electron and so it's positive. 

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:17,000
Or the atom that lost the electron could get it back again and then both atoms would
be neutral. 

3
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:25,000
Or maybe both could happen, depending on the atoms involved. But I'm not sure why.
