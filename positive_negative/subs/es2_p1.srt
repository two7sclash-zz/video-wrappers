00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:11,000
In our first investigation, we learned that there are two types of electric charge.

1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
For now, we're calling them "pointy charge" and "square charge." We learned that they 
really are different...

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,500
...since like-charged objects repel each other and unlike-charged objects attract each 
other.

3
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:31,000
In our next set of investigations, we'll explore how things actually become charged and
what it means to call a charge either postive or negative. 

4
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,250
Okay, so now I think I understand what happened with my hair earlier.

5
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:42,000
Just like two tapes that have the same charge, they all repelled each other. 

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
But what I don't understand is when you pull two tapes apart, they become oppositely 
charged. 

7
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:58,000
Professor: Good question. You actually know a lot about that, but we just have to apply
your knowledge. 

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,500
Think about the tapes and the sticky stuff. What are they made of?

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You mean like on a really small scale? Like atoms? 
Professor: Yeah, on a small scale. 

10
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:14,500
Well, everything's made of atoms. So, atoms and molecules, I guess.
Professor: Okay.

11
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,500
So, where does charge come into this? 

12
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:23,500
Leah: Protons and electrons are in the charged parts of atoms. 
Sidney: And molecules are made from atoms. 

13
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,500
Professor: Okay, so now what holds the atoms together in the molecule?

14
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:33,500
Robert: Chemical bonds. 
Sidney: Okay, chemical bonds are when atoms kind of share electrons. 

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,500
Professor: Okay, can you say more about that?

16
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:46,000
Well, when atoms come together, the electrons from one of the atoms kind of are attracted
more to the space in between the two atoms. 

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:54,500
Oh, so then the electrons that are in between the atoms will attract the other part of
the atom that's more postive. 

18
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,000
And so it'll kind of hold the whole thing together.

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Professor: Very good. So, now what happens when we break the bonds between atoms in the 
molecule?
