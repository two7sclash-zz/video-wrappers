00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
So, we've now seen that as long as there is this pushing force on this cart, it speeds up.

1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It actually gets faster and faster and faster as long as there is a pushing. 

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
This is what's actually known as Newton's Second Law, or at least it's a precursor to Newton's Second Law.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
In order for us to really understand Newton's Second Law we'll have to go back to the lab

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and do some more careful measurements.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
OK, here we are in the lab where we can reproduce the rocket cart experiment in a much more controlled environment.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I have here a long track and a low-friction cart with a fan attached to it. 

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Unlike the CO2 container which loses gas and therefore exerts a decreasing force,

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
the fan will exert a constant force on the cart. 

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Let's see what happens in this constant-force situation.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Are you ready? Three, two, one...
