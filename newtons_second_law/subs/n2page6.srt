When I did the analysis, I saw that the velocity time graph was a straight line.

1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
In other words, the velocity increased at a steady rate. 

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The slope of a velocity time graph is what we call the acceleration,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and what we've just seen is that a constant force leads to a constant acceleration. 

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
In reality, there are many forces acting on an object, so a more accurate statement is,

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
a constant NET force leads to a constant acceleration. 

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Now what I'd like to do is repeat the previous experiment with one small change. 

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'll use the same fan as before so that we have the same force,

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
but I'd like to add mass to the cart so there's exactly twice as much mass as there was in the previous experiment.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:48,000
How do you think the acceleration will change when you have the same force acting on a cart with twice the mass?
