To determine the motion of the cart, let's do a video analysis. If you click on the yellow dot on the side of the cart

1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
you'll get a velocity time graph of this constant-force motion.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Does the velocity increase in a steady or uniform manner?
