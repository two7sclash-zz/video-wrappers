00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now that you've made a prediction of whether the cart speeds up or not,

1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
let's make some measurements to be sure. 

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We're going to do a video analysis of the cart movie. 

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
If you click on the little white marker on the cart in each frame of the movie,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
the computer will calculate the cart's velocity by determining how much its position changes

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and dividing by the time interval. 

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The velocity time graph will be constructed as you click on each frame in the movie. 

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
By the time the graph is complete, you'll know whether or not your prediction was correct.
