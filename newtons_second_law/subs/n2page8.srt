00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Here are the velocity time graphs for the two experiments we just performed. 

1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
In addition to the experimental data, you'll see a line that can be moved around by dragging on its ends.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
You should move the line on each graph to fit the experimental data as best you can. 

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and make note of the accelerations. How do the accelerations compare with each other?
