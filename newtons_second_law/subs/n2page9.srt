00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Now, when I adjusted the lines, I saw that the acceleration was only half as large for the cart with twice the mass.

1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Another way of saying this is that the acceleration and the mass are inversely proportional to each other.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Or, that the mass times acceleration is constant. 

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
But we also know that the force is constant in these experiments.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Hmm... could it be that the force is equal to the mass times acceleration?

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
In fact, we can show that if the mass is held constant, 

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
doubling the force leads to twice the acceleration. 

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
If we put this all together, we come up with the statement that 

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
the net force is proportional to mass times acceleration.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Using appropriate units, we can then say that the net force is equal to mass times acceleration,

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
which is commonly referred to as Newton's Second Law.
