00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:10,500
We're here at the tennis courts at Dickinson College to do a very exciting experiment.

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:17,500
And what we have is a canister of compressed gas, carbon dioxide, connected to a wheeled vehicle.

3
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:25,500
When we open the nozzle the carbon dioxide shoots out and that will push the cart in the other direction.

4
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,500
I'd like to ask you a couple of questions.

5
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:34,500
When I get on the cart and turn on the nozzle, what do you think is going to happen?

6
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:41,500
I think that you will be propelled forward and possibly start decreasing in speed.

7
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:48,500
I basically agree with all that. I think it's going to shoot in the opposite direction of the gas and then slow it down.

8
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,500
Well, we're going to try the experiment and actually see what happens.

9
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,500
Are we ready? 
Yeah!

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,500
What did you observe?

11
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,500
It's kinda the opposite of what we expected. It took a little time to like gain momentum and then it got slowly faster.

12
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,500
So, it was speeding up? 

13
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:19,500
Yes. So if she has not caught you with the rope you would have kept speeding up and going faster.

14
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:25,500
Really? So that's not what you thought initially. Maybe we are learning some physics. 

15
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,500
It wasn't as dramatic as I thought it might be. I didn't move very fast.

16
00:01:30,500 -->  00:01:34,000
So if we tried it again without me on, what do you think would happen?

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I think it would be more of an immediate reaction.. Not immediate, but it wouldn't take as long to speed up.

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And you think it would speed up the whole time? 

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I think so until at least most of the pressure is released.

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,500
As long as there is a force acting.

21
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:57,500
OK, so we have another prediction. We'll try it one more time without a passenger and see if the results aren't a little more dramatic. 

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
What did you see?

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,500
It went significantly faster. 

24
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,500
Was it speeding up the whole time or did it go at a constant speed?

25
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,500
I believe it was speeding up until the rope stopped it. 

26
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:21,500
Sometimes it can be hard to tell if it's actually speeding up, so we might do a little bit of analysis

27
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,500
and actually try and measure to see if it's speeding up.
