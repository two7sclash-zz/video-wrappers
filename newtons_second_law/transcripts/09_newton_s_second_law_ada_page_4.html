Professor David is explaining.

Professor David: Now that you've made a prediction of whether the cart speeds up or not, 
let's make some measurements to be sure. We're going to do a video analysis of the cart movie. 
If you click on the little white marker on the cart in each frame of the movie, the computer will 
calculate the cart's velocity by determining how much its position changes and dividing by the time interval. 
The velocity time graph will be constructed as you click on each frame in the movie.
