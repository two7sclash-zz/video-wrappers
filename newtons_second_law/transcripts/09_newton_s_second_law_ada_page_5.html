  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
Professor David is speaking with the same girls at the tennis court.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Professor David: So, we've now seen that as long as there is this pushing force on this cart, 
it speeds up. It actually gets faster and faster and faster as long as there is a pushing. 
This is what's actually known as Newton's Second Law, or at least it's a precursor to Newton's 
Second Law. In order for us to really understand Newton's Second Law we'll have to go back to the 
lab and do some more careful measurements.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
Professor David is in the lab now. 
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Professor David: OK, here we are in the lab where we can reproduce the rocket cart experiment 
in a much more controlled environment. I have here a long track and a low friction cart.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
Professor David pushes the cart along the track and it moves almost uniformly.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
With a fan attached to it. 
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The professor takes the cart, turns on the fan and blows on his hair. Then he turns the fan off.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Professor David: Unlike the CO2 container which looses gas and therefore exerts a decreasing force, 
the fan will exert a constant force on the cart. Let's see what happens in this constant force situation.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The professor puts the cart at the beginning of the track.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Are you ready? 
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
The professor turns the fan on.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Speaker)</i></b><br>
Three, two, one.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>(Description)</i></b><br>
Professor David releases the cart and it moves accelerating up to the end of the track.
